THE HINDU SATURDAY,JULY17,2021 6EDITORIALAudit of cases Why not have an audit system to review  cases booked by the NIA and the CBI? This could help and assist the judiciary function quicker and lessen the burden as there would have been initial scrutiny .Father Stan Swamy™s case can serve as an indicator to reassess ground realities.  Inthe implementation of l aws, the humane angle should not be missed.  Compassion also forms a vital ingredient of the justice system (Editorial page, ﬁA strong Indian state must be humane tooﬂ, July 16). Balasubramaniam Pavani, Secunderabad On astrology The tug of war between astrology and astronomy perhaps began with the invention of the telescope and intensi†ed with technological advancement of the instrument! It is also true that those who claim to be depending on core scienti†c principles look down upon astrology by calling it a pseudoscience (OpEd page, ﬁNo pseudoscience, pleaseﬂ, July 15). There appears to be some lack of scienti†c approach in the criticism. Prima facie , astrology, in di“erent forms, exists in all parts of the world. To my knowledge, astrological conclusions, to a large extent, are based on trial and error. The results could be summed up only out of the experiences of thousands of people. After all, ‚probability™ is an accepted mathematical area. Naturally, results are also a“ected accordingly. Anyway, it gives mental comfort and con†dence among a lot of people, just as modern psychiatry or psychology does. One real malady with astrology is that many of those who practise it are not wellversed in their own profession. Moreover, further research or study is needed to improve the reliability of the system. In any case, the right of other persons to demand exclusion of astrology from mainstream subjects by universities can be considered to be only under their ‚right to free speech™, especially if there are course applicants. P.R.V. Raja, Pandalam, Kerala nThis is the age of science and where there needs to be an incessant thirst for research and innovations. Therefore, it is strange that the premier institute, IGNOU, is launching a  degree course in astrology. The government of the day would be furthering the cause of the nation™s development only if it eschews was interesting to know that there was an acute housing problem in Madras even in 1921 (OpEd page, ‚From the Archives™ , July 16), which shows the usefulness of census data. It was R.A. Gopalaswami, ICS, Registrar General, India who, for the 1951 Census,sounded the warning on population explosion by propounding his theory of ﬁimprovident maternityﬂ and laid the foundation for the implementation of family planning. It was later incorporated in the First Five Year Plan. N. Rama Rao, Chennaiantiscienti†c trends .Seshagiri Row Karry, Hyderabad nThere does not seem to be anything objectionable in IGNOU launching this degree course . Amajority of Indians do consult astrologers before taking important decisions in their life. There are rites and rituals which do not have any scienti†c basis but still give hope and con†dence to the believers. Let them exist with scienti†c principles.

It LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Letters emailed to letters@thehindu.co.in must carry the full postal address and the full name or the name with initials. To read more letters online, scan the QR code Vandana Prasad & Dipa Sinha Many of us working in the †eld of public health and social development have been taken aback, if not down right shocked, by the recently an nounced draft Uttar Pradesh Pop ulation (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021 (https:// bit.ly/3eoMRh3) that focuses ex clusively on making a twochild norm a law, specifying various in centives and penalties for contra vention. The burgeoning negative reaction to this proposal derives from a variety of inherent dangers, but also because most experts would agree that the conceptual clarity on ‚development being the best contraception™ and the irra tionality of incentivesdisincen tives had been, ostensibly, long settled.  As early as 1994, the Pro gramme of Action of the Interna tional Conference on Population and Development (UN 1994); to which India is a signatory, strongly avers that coercion, incentives and disincentives have little role to play in population stabilis ation and need to be replaced by the principle of informed free choice.  This principle is also echoed in the National Population Policy 2000, which unequivocally sup ports a targetfree approach and explicitly focuses on education, maternal and child health and sur vival, and the availability of healthcare services, including contraceptive services, as key stra tegies for population stabilis ation. The logic and rationale for this glo bal and national articulation against incentives and disincen tives, and in favour of the develop mental measures mentioned above applies as much to Uttar Pradesh and other S tates today as they did when these policies were formulated. Signs of stabilisation Consider the rationale below with the facts as they stand: The population of India, and Ut tar Pradesh is on the road to stabil isation regardless of coercive poli cies such as the twochild norm. The fertility rate for Uttar Pradesh (National Family Health Survey, or NFHS4) is 2.7, compared to 3.8 10 years ago (NFHS3). This trend is correlated with improvements in health indicators for the S tate, such as infant mortality rate (IMR), maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and malnutrition, in the same pe riod.  There are many States that have attained the replacementlevel fer tility rate of 2.1 by NFHS4 such as Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Hima chal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, West Bengal (excluding Union Territo ries and some northeastern States); all of which have much better development indicators. For instance, by NFHS4, child mortality rate in Uttar Pradesh is 78 compared to seven in Kerala and 27 in Tamil Nadu . Women with 10 or more years of schooling stand at 33% in Uttar Pradesh com pared to 72% in Kerala and 50% in Tamil Nadu. Thus, there is much scope for acceleration of popula tion stabilisation through better delivery of health and education services.  Issue of child sex ratios Second , one of the greatest con cerns with coercive policies such as the twochild norm is their po tential impact upon child sex ra tios in a society that has such a high preference for male children. That this concern is only too real is well demonstrated by the example of China that had to detract from its stringent onechild norm, †rst in favour of a twochild norm and then to remove targets altogether, after experiencing a disastrous re duction in its child sex ratio. Con sidering that Uttar Pradesh is amongst the worst across Indian States, with the lowest child sex ra tio of 903 compared with 1,047 in Kerala and 954 in Tamil Nadu, and that; unlike other development in dicators, this has deteriorated in NFHS4 compared to NFHS3, why it would want to take such a fool hardy misstep is hard to understand. The correlation between poor socioeconomic status and family size also impacts the potentially discriminatory e“ect of the pro posed measures upon communi ties that house the poorest of the poor, such as the religious minori ties and Dalits, as already pointed out by many. Leaving these com munities out of political and admi nistrative spacesas well as curtail ing their access to welfare is hardly likely to advance any kind of social justice or equity. In our experience with poor communities that are often blamed for not exerting popula tion control, a vast majority are keen to receiveand actively seek contraceptive services. With an unmet need of 18% in Uttar Pra desh (as compared to, for exam ple, 10% in Tamil Nadu), it is the State that is failing to provide a ser vice at all to almost a †fth of its pe ople that actively seek it, and ser vices with quality to a far higher percentage. If the law has to be used to correct the situation, why do we not see a move to enact ‚the Right to Healthcare™ as being de manded by health groups for de cades? And why do we not †nd pe nalties upon the State for failing to provide services on demand with in a reasonable period of time within this law itself? We still have memory of hun dreds of lives needlessly lost and human rights violations in almost criminal sterilis ation ‚camps™ that the Supreme Court of India had to step in to regulate ( Devika Biswas vsUnion of India & Others , Petition No. 95 of 2012). Most recently, a disabled man from a village in Ut tar Pradesh was lured into going for a COVID19 vaccination and was forcibly sterilised instead to ful†l targets .Awrong path to follow Clearly, as is evident in so many antiquated ‚control™ measures the state has been displaying in recent times, the Government has no trust in the ability of its citizens to take wellreasoned steps for their own welfare. Rather than do its job as a supporter of these decisions, and a duty bearer towards their rights, the state visualises itself as apaternal †gure that must ‚con trol™ a recalcitrant immature pop ulace at best, and a policeman wielding the law as an instrument of imperiousness at worst. This ir rational and illconsidered pro posed Act should be retracted forthwith if the Uttar Pradesh go vernment has any appreciation for the collective understanding based on decades of scienti†c evi dence of what does and does not work for population stabilis ation. Instead, we are seeing other State governments displaying signs of following its lead. Clearly, it is ea sier for our governments to blame the victims of maldevelopment and apply penalties upon them than be held accountable for their own failures in delivering basic services of health and education.

So, w hat does the new Health M inister need to learn from previous experience, and what un†nished tasks need to be taken forward? As citizens, how should we expect the  Government to perform better on the public health front, given the lessons of the COVID19 pandemic? If the Un ion Health Ministry acts upon the following health system lessons, this would not only enable im proved handling of COVID19, but would also have widespread posi tive impacts extending much beyond the COVID19 situation.  Two States and a comparison For any population, the availabili ty of functional public health sys tems is literally a question of life and death. This is evident by com paring two States which  currently have the highest number of CO VID19 cases in India Š  Maharash tra and Kerala. Their per capita gross State domestic product (GSDP), re’ecting the overall eco nomic situation in each S tate, is si milar. However, their COVID19 case fatality rates are hugely di“e rent Š this being 0.4 8% for Kerala and 2.0 4% for Maharashtra, with the shocking implication that on average, a COVID19 patient in Maharashtra has been  over four times more likely to die when compared to one in Kerala.  Amajor reason for such critical divergence is likely to be the huge di“erences in the e“ectiveness of public health systems. Kerala has per capita two and a half times more government doctors, and an equally higher proportion of go vernment hospital beds when compared to Maharashtra, while allocating per capita over one and half times higher funds on public health every year. Despite Maha rashtra having a large private healthcare sector, its weak public health system has proved to be a critical de†ciency. In contrast, robust government healthcare services in Kerala have translated into: a more e“ective outreach, timely testing, early case detection and more rational treatment for COVID patients, which all together reduce fatality rates. Existing evidence from the COVID19 pandemicprovides a clear message: a neglect of public health systems can mean large scale, avoidable losses of lives; hence, public health services must be upgraded rapidly and massive ly as a topmost priority. Focus on public health  Talking of priorities, if the š20,000 crore or nearabout allo cated for the Central Vista project were to be utilised instead to  set up oxygen plants, twothirds of the  over 25,000 government hos pitals across India could acquire their own oxygen source, thus helping to save the lives of lakhs of COVID19 and nonCOVID19 pa tients. A larger programme which requires the immediate attention of the  Health Minister is the Na tional Health Mission (NHM); since 201718, Union government alloca tions for the NHM have declined in real terms, resulting in inadequate support to States for core activities such as  immunisation, while sys temic gaps a“ect the delivery of COVID19 vaccination.  Although urban people across India have experienced major shortages of public health services during COVID19, the condition of the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) remains pathetic. This year™s Central allocation for the NUHM is š 1,000 crore, which amounts to less than š2 per month per urban Indian. This  situation must change, and as recommend ed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee, for reaching National Health Policy targets, the  Govern ment must allocate š1.6lakh crore for public health during the cur rent year. This would amount to a doubling of the present c entral health B udget, which could enable major strengthening of health ser vices in rural and urban areas across the country. Private sector regulation Another clear priority that has been highlighted during the CO VID19 pandemic  is the need to regulate rates and standards of care in the private sector. Massive hospital bills have caused untold distress even among the middle class;COVID19 care often costs  š1lakh to š3 lakhper week in large private hospitals. The ‚Remdesivir panic™ was signi†cantly linked with major overuse of this medi cine by unregulated private hospi tals, despite the drug lacking e cacy to reduce COVID19 mortality. Although various deter minants have contributed to the Mucormycosis outbreak, irration al use of steroids in COVID19 pa tients, especially diabetics, ap pears to be an important factor.  Yet, despite accumulating evi dence on the need for comprehen sive regulation of private hospi tals, the central government is yet to take necessary steps to promote the implementation of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act (CEA).  Passed in 2010 and presently applicable to 11 States across India, this A ct is not e“ectively imple mented due to a major delay in noti†cation of central minimum standards, and failure to develop the central framework for regula tion of rates. Responding to public distress, around 15  State govern ments invoked disasterrelated provisions to regulate rates for CO VID19 treatment in private hospi tals. However, initiatives from the central government to promote regulation of private hospitals dur ing the COVID19 situation are con spicuously inadequate. Learning from stark market failures during the COVID19 pandemic ,  compre hensive regulation of private health care in public interest now must be a critical agenda for the new Health Minister. NITI Aayog  prescriptions Alogical corollary of the †rst two lessons is that health services should not be further privatised. However, ’ying in the face of healthcare distress faced by or dinary Indians during the last 16 months, NITIAayog has recently published the document, ‚Invest ment Opportunities in India™s Healthcare Sector™ (https:// bit.ly/3em8myP). This promotes further privatisation of health care in a country which already has one of the most privatised health sys tems in the world.  Published in the midst of wides pread experiences of largescale overcharging and irrational care by private providers during the COVID19 epidemic, the report fails to acknowledge the negative aspects of unregulated private health care; neither is there any mention of the need for regulation of private hospitals. Instead, the document celebrates the CO VID19 epidemic as a prime busi ness opportunity to be exploited, stating that  ‚i n the hospital seg ment, the expansion of private players to Tier 2 and Tier 3 loca tions, beyond metropolitan cities, o“ers an attractive investment op portunity™. Proposals for handing over public hospitals to private op erators, who would presumably now run these key public institu tions on commercial lines under the ‚Viability Gap Funding™ scheme are deeply worrisome, es pecially since public health servic es which were hitherto free of cost, would begin to be charged for.  Assuming that the Union Health Ministry has a primary mandate to shape national health policy in In dia,  the Health Minister must ass ert his authority to stop such moves for further privatisation, which might bene†t healthcare corporates but would be damag ing for ordinary people. To conclude, this is a time when it is critical to rebuild people™s trust in public health systems. This would help in overcoming CO VID19 vaccination hesitancy while strengthening the promo tion of healthy behaviours neces sary to deal with the current wave of COVID19 and prevent a  third wave . This would be done best if the new Health Minister acts on three core health system lessons of the COVID19 pandemicŠ a need for strengthening public health systems; regulating private health care, and preventing further priva tisation of the health sector. It is not unjusti†ed to expect our new Health Minister to present an ex ample to the people of India, by acting decisively for public health systems.  Dr. Abhay Shukla, a public health professional and health activist, is a National Coconvenor of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan India needs a renewed healthcare  system The new Health Minister needs to focus on the core lessons from the pandemic and rebuild trust in public health  Abhay Shukla GETTY IMAGES Fresh daily cases of the coronavirus, globally, after touching a new peak of over 0.9 million on April 28,  began to drop steadily, reaching a low point on June 21 , when only over 0.3 million cases were re ported. But there has been a rise  in cases, again global ly, since then. July 15 saw  0.53 million daily cases and the second week of the monthwitnessed nearly three million new cases. A total of 188.9 million cases have been reported worldwideas on July 15, driven in most countries by the  highly transmissive Delta variant. A  to tal of 111 countries now have this  variant . Brazil, India, Indonesia, the U.K. and Colombia have reported the most cases in the past week, with  the sharpest increase being in Zimbabwe (72%), Indonesia (44%), the U.S. (38%), Bangladesh (35%), and the U.K. (30%). Many Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, where  the spread was under control, have also been reporting a high number of daily cases. Indonesia has seen a surge in n ew cases , with each  day witnessing a sharp increase over the previous day. With 56,757 cases on July 15, Indonesia is now  the new Asian epicentre ; India reported over 39,000 cases on July 15. According to  WHO, COVID19 deaths are increasing again after falling for nine straight weeks, with the shar pest upticks  in Africa and Southeast Asia. On July 7, the total  global COVID19 deaths crossed four million. It took just 90 days  for the last million deaths to occur, the shortest time span for every one million deaths recorded. The U.S. and much of Europe have demonstrated how high vaccination coverage  can sharply reduce the number of deaths and even hospitalisation. For in stance, with over 87% of the adult population vaccinat ed with one dose and over 67% with two doses in the U.K., there have been fewer hospitalisations and deaths despite spikes in cases. In the U.S., the case rise  is  large lyin States with low vaccination coverage, and deaths mainly in the unvaccinated. Over 55% of the U.S. popu lation has had one dose ; 48% are fully vaccinated. This brings the focus back on increasing vaccination cove r age and striving for global vaccine equity to prevent deaths and the emergence of deadlier variants. Ironi cally, the discussion in some countries is on a boos ter dose even while healthcare workers in many African countries have not been fully vaccinated. Israel has be gun giving booster shots to people with a compromised immune system, while the U.S. has ruled out booster shots for now. With several Indian States reporting vac cine shortages, strict adherence to COVIDappropriat ebehaviour even by the fully vaccinated is the only w ay to delay and reduce the impact of a third wave. Rising again Adherence to COVIDappropriate behaviour is the only way to reduce impact of a third wave It is gratifying to note that the Supreme Court, while indicating its intention to reconsider the sedition provision in the IPC , has raised the question most re levant to the issue: ﬁWhy does Section 124A continue in the statute book even after 75 years of independence?ﬂ The Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana, has also point ed to its rampant misuse  by the police across the coun try, and reminded the G overnment that it was a legal provision that the colonial regime had used to suppress the freedom movement. The issues ’agged by the CJI may set the tone for what would be a comprehensive re consideration of a section that has been frequently and wrongfully used, especially in the last few years, to sup press dissent, criminalise strident political critic ism and taint opponents with the tag of being ‚antinati on al™. Even though it is often argued that the misuse  of a law alone does not render it invalid, there is a spe cial case to strike down Section 124A because of its inherent potential for misuse. There is a pattern of behaviour among all regimes that indicate a proclivity to invoke it without examining its applicability to the facts of any case. Recent cases show that sedition is used for th ree political reasons: to suppress criticism and protests against particular policies and projects of the gove rn ment, to criminalise dissenting opinion from  rights de fenders, lawyers, activists and journalists, and to settle political scores, sometimes with communal hues. It is not to be forgotten that the section was upheld in 1962 by a Constitution Bench mainly by reading down the import of the terms ﬁbring into hatred or con temptﬂ, or ﬁto create disa“ection towards the govern ment established by lawﬂ and limit its scope to only those instances of speech or writing that show a perni cious tendency to create public disorder. Without th is attenuated interpretation, the restriction imposed on free speech by Section 124A would have been declared unconstitutional. The C ourt is now seized of several cases that seek a reconsideration of the 1962 verdict, citing more recent judgments expanding the scope of fundamental rights and doctrines that have been subse quently evolved. In particular, the ﬁchilling e“ectﬂ that alaw may have on free speech and the vague and ‚over broad™ de†nition of sedition that renders both provoca tive and innocuous speeches or writings equally liab le for prosecution, are points to be examined. In 2016, the Government itself admitted in Parliament that the de† nition of sedition is too wide and requires reconsidera tion. The Law Commission™s  consultation paper in 2018 had said: ﬁIn a democracy, singing from the same song book is not a benchmark of patriotism... People should be at liberty to show their a“ection towards their coun try in their own way.ﬂ While issuing fresh guidelines and safeguards is one way of quelling the potential  for its misuse, it will be more helpful if Section 124A i sstruck down altogether. Overdue review Supreme Court™s remarks on sedition cases bode well for its inevitable invalidation

SATURDAY,JULY17,2021 11Russia on Friday blamed the ﬁhasty withdrawalﬂ of U.S. and NATO troops for a rapid deterioration in Afghanis tan™s security and warned of instability spreading to neighbouring countries. Taliban insurgents in Af ghanistan have capitalised on the last stages of the with drawal of foreign troops to launch o†ensives, capturing aswath of districts and bor der crossings, and encircling provincial capitals. The White House had tried to paint the drawdown of foreign troops in ﬁthe most positive coloursﬂ, Rus sian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday. ﬁBut everyone under stands that the mission failed,ﬂ he told reporters at a conference in Uzbekistan™s capital Tashkent.  ﬁIn recent days we have unfortunately seen a rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan,ﬂ Mr. Lavrov said. ﬁIn light of the hasty withdrawal of the U.S. and NATO troops, there is huge uncertainty around the fu ture of the political and mili tary situation in this coun try,ﬂ he added. Russia hosted Taliban re presentatives in Moscow last week, where the insurgent group claimed to have con trol over some 85% of Afghanistan. Moscow is closely watch ing the Taliban™s advance and concerned about the po tential for instability reach ing neighbouring Central Asian countries of the form er Soviet Union where Russia maintains military bases.

Mr. Li in a phone call said ﬁChina hopes Pakistan can provide assistance and use all necessary means to inves tigate the attack and bring the terrorists involved to jus tice,ﬂ the Communist Party run  Global Times  reported, adding Premier Li ﬁurged Pakistan to take e†ective measures to enhance the protection of Chinese per sonnel and organisations in Pakistan to avoid similar incidents.ﬂ He also ﬁstressed the Chi nese government pays high attention to the security of Chinese citizens and organi sations overseasﬂ. Pakistani o’cials had in itially described the incident that claimed the lives of nine Chinese nationals, who were working at the Dasu hydro power project, part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, and four Pakista nis as an accident, before subsequently saying traces of explosives had been detected. China said it had dis patched a work team, which had arrived in Pakistan and would ﬁcoordinateﬂ with lo cal authorities as investiga tions progress.

He said the group ﬁin re cent years targeted Chinese projects in the country, and launched attacks on Chinese tourists, as well as business people, as they know that Pakistan attaches great im portance to ChinaPakistan ties, and they aim to use such attacks to sabotage bi lateral relations.ﬂ Li urges Imran Khan to take steps to avoid similar incidents  Ananth Krishnan Bring to justice those behind  terror attack, China tells Pak.

Sri Lanka also reopened the country for tourists, further easing restrictions on Friday for fully vaccinat ed travellers, except from India, and select African and South American coun tries, from where passen gers are still barred entry in to Sri Lanka.  Vaccine coverage  According to government sources, the island nation is counting on the possible re vival of its tourism sector to face its severe economic cri sis, of draining foreign re serves in the face of a daunt ing debt repayment schedule in the coming months.  Beginning in January this year, Sri Lanka has been ad ministering Covishield, Si nopharm, Sputnik and P“z er vaccines, and a majority of those vaccinated has got Sinopharm jabs.

AFP/FILE China to send more  vaccines to Sri Lanka  The U.S. will not recognise a Taliban government tha t takes power by force, said U.S. special Representative for Afghanis tan reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad, striking a di†erence from the British Defence Minister, who suggested this week that the U.K. would engage with any government in power in Afghanistan. In an interaction, Mr. Khalilzad also said Pakis tan must ful“l its ﬁspecial responsibilityﬂ towards peace  in Afghanistan The Taliban do not seem to be waiting for the outcome of intraAfghan talks, and are making advances on cities. We heard from the Afghan First VicePresident yesterday that Pakistan is threatening to use missiles, if the Afghan Air Force acts against the Taliban. What, if anything, is the U.S. prepared to do if the Taliban forcibly take power in Kabul, and try to take over the country? nWell, there is no ultimate military solution, there has to be a political settlement for lasting peace in Afghanis tan, and it has been made clear to the Taliban that not only ourselves, but many countries in the region and beyond will not recognise, will not assist the govern ment that takes power by force. For an agreement that can produce stability, and peace and progress for Af ghan people, we need two key features Š it has to be broadly accepted by the Af ghan people. And it has to have the support and accep tance of the neighbours and donors and other countries around the world.  And  for those two things to happen, there is a need for apolitical dispensation, for a political agreement, for polit ical arrangements that pro duce an inclusive govern ment that re‘ects the diversity of Afghanistan, and that  government respects the fundamental rights of all Af ghans, men, women. People of Afghanistan must be given the opportunity to have a say in the choice of how they™re governed and who governs them. And “nally, that Af ghanistan doesn™t pose a threat to the neighbours and beyond by allowing terrorists to use its territory, whether groups or individuals. There is an international consensus on these principles. And all the neighbours one way or the other have said the same. And so I know that there are military movements and de velopments, but ultimately what is needed is a political settlement for these aspira tions for peace and develop ment to be achieved. But what if that doesn™t happen? What is the U.S., if anything, prepared to do? nWe will continue to sup port the Afghan government. We have said that while forc es withdraw, yes, that is on going. But we will support the Afghan security forces where the [U.S.] President™s budget has asked for $3.3 bil lion in assistance for the Af ghan security forces. We will provide economic support, we will provide humanitar ian support. And at the same time, we will work with oth ers to press for these objec tives that I described. You said the neighbours are on board, yet we see this threat apparently from Pakistan, saying they will practically give a cover to the Taliban if the Afghan Air Force were to act against them in Spin Boldak. nI don't know whether the Pakistanis have said that, we don™t know that. The Pakista ghanistan. And we agree despite the challenges that exist, and we have to address those challenges, that a polit ical settlement of the kind I described is the ultimate so lution. There is really no mil itary solution.  Some may have the illu sion that there may be a mil itary solution. But the costs of pushing for a military solu tion will be very high, and it will not achieve the objec tives that I described. The Ta liban said they [don™t want to be shunned] and want to be accepted by the neighbours and by the international community as a legitimate actor, partner in the future. And those are aspirations that cannot be achieved if the military solution is sought. ni Prime Minister is here, the Afghan President is here... I hope they will meet.  It™s vital that Pakistan play its role in helping Afghans to achieve an agreement of the kind that I described. And Pakistan has a special res ponsibility in this regard. So we™re working with all sides in the service of those objectives.
