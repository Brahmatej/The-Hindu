But the reality is that for several decades, the U.S. has imposed a crippling embargo and tried to do everything possible to see that Cuba™s su†ering is intensi“ed .  We have seen the U.S.™s role in Afghanistan, and its role in Cuba would be no di†erent. It is a clear case of imperialist aggression. It should end this naked and notorious aggression which the world only knows too well.  When the entire world went through the worst form of epidemic and many countries with poor management of the crisis and severe economic depression did not see any protests, then what is peculiar to Cuba needs no explanation. N.G.R. Prasad, K.K. Ram Siddhartha, ChennaiTaliban™s betrayal The Taliban™s “ghting in Afghanistan has become a matter of grave concern not only for that country but for other neighbouring countries too. The speed with which the Taliban took control of a major portion of Afghanistan, just after America™s pulling out of its troops, shows that they were waiting all along for this to happen. As in the agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban, the only item, and being implemented, is the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan; all other points have been  ignored, which is blatant betrayal by the Taliban. Unity is the only viable solution to develop Afghanistan into a peaceful country.  D.

To read more letters online, scan the QR code Anuradha Raman It was the June of 2002 and the Information and Broadcasting Ministry o’ce on the “fth and the sixth ‘oors of Shastri Bhavan, New Delhi, was buzzing with activ- ity. Cable operators referred to as ﬁunsavoury charactersﬂ had taken over the conference room which was over‘owing with pizza and soft drinks. Reporters could come and go and talk to o’cials; usually the S ecretary and the A dditional Secretary would come out to brief the reporters. There was a reason for this ‘urry of activity. The CableTelevision Networks (Regulation) Amendment Bill, which had the potential of regulating the busi- ness of lakhs of cable operators, multi-system operators and broad- casters, was going to be debated in Parliament and it was the draft of the proposed Bill that was being discussed threadbare with stake- holders.  Then and  now The discussions spilled over months as reporters munched through the pizzas. The M inistry was careful to keep the stakehol- ders away from each other. Such was the unease between the stake- holders. It was evident to all of us that while Ministry o’cials were comfortable discussing the provi- sion of the proposed Bill with broadcasters, cable operators were a di†erent kettle of “sh. So, while the broadcasters were invit- ed at dusk, the cable operators held sway during the day. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee g overnment, much like the present G overn- ment, was clueless about the num- ber of cable operators; many had sizeable stakes in the real estate business in the country and car- ried the channels for a price which was at the centre of animosity bet- ween the broadcasters and the ca- ble operators. Eventually passed by Parlia- ment in 2002, the Cable Television Networks  Regulation (Amend- ment) Act was not a perfect Act, and would undergo many more amendments, but the changes were the outcome of intense dis- cussions with all stakeholders.  In the days to come, the Act would be criticis ed but the doors of the Mi- nistry were always open for dis- cussions. This is a marked depar- ture from the manner in which the new Information Technology (In- termediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which has sought to put the brakes on free speech, is being pushed through. OTT in focus Of course, the Government can al- ways turn back and say, ‚hey we gave you 100 days™. But here is the rub. The Government never put up for public discussion what it was seeking to amend and control. The  November 2020 Executive or- der bringing Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms or video streaming ser- vice providers such as Net‘ix, Amazon Prime and others under the ambit of the Ministry of Infor- mation and Broadcasting, exposed the real intentions of the G overn- ment. But when the now former Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Ja- vadekar commented that the M i- nistry o’cials had no “x on the number of OTTplatforms  and us- ers in the country, his concern was legitimate. After all, this is a busi- ness and along with the entertain- ment industry, had reached š 1.82 trillion in 2019 and has been pro- jected to cross š2.4 trillion by 2022 (FICCI report on media and enter- tainment; https://bit.ly/36xaDTJ) .In fact, digital media overtook “lmed entertainment in 2019. And to throw in some more “gures, there are around 550 million tele- vision and smartphone consumers in the country. The “gures are ex- pected to double by 2025 .There are over 200 million OTT subscribers. The major draw of OTT is this: the content being served to you when you want it. You are free to watch what you wish to at a time chosen by you on aplatform you are comfortable with. Your smartphone doubles up as the screen as you navigate your ride on the metro. This  is in danger now with the IT rules having come into e†ect on February 25 (https://bit.ly/3riYdZn and https://bit.ly/3i8KEHF) with the Government giving digital pu- blishers three months to comply (https://bit.ly/3B1qQ1E). The Digi- tal News Publishers Association Š a13-member collective of some of the leading news media compa- nies, the Press Trust of India and now the News Broadcasters Asso- ciation , have moved  courts peti- tioning them to intervene and stop the code which not only restricts free speech but also far exceeds the mandate of the IT Act in empo- wering the executive from con- trolling online content.  Incidentally, while amending the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 , to bring within its ambit digital news platforms two years ago, for good measure, the Ministry had put  out the draft on its website (draft ﬁRegistration of Press and Periodicals Bill, 2019) in- viting discussions (https:// bit.ly/3AWRuZl). So, it is all the more surprising why the M inistry did not follow the same process while attempting to regulate OTT and digital news platforms. It could have got a “x on both.  Rules elsewhere Since the best of rules and guide- lines are often enriched by best practices around the world, here is a brief list of some of these. The EU Audiovisual Media Services Di- rective, updated three years ago, encourages self-regulation and co- regulation among players, with speci“c focus on child safety and violence and hate speech. In the United Kingdom, programming on video-on-demand services, includ- ing TV and online “lm services, is regulated by Ofcom which not on- ly provides editorial rules but also has speci“c provisions for protect- ing those under 18 and the prohibi- tion of content inciting hatred. The United States, perhaps the most liberal of countries, expects Pay TV players to follow Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines Š OTT content re- mains unregulated. So, from a light touch to content governing children, most countries have set up an enabling architecture for OTT platforms to grow. India, it appears, has not followed in their footsteps, instead, charting a regu- latory framework which has been characteris ed by excessive govern- ment overreach. Unease over free speech More importantly, does the go- vernment of the day have the man- date to control and regulate digital news? And here the G overnment, many of whose Ministers  had bur- nished their reputation as cham- pions of free speech during the Emergency, has ‘oundered . Much like the Constitution makers who had decided to retain some of the most draconian provisions of laws controlling freedom of expression, the present government too ap- pears to have followed the same path and has expressed its uneasi- ness over free speech on numer- ous occasions. The plate of newly minted Information and Broad- casting Minister Anurag Thakur is over‘owing. For one, he can pose aquestion to himself: should the Government formulate a self-regu- lating code for digital media? Does that even make sense? At the heart of content, both news and entertainment, is the freedom of expression Šthe life- giving force behind content. Final- ly, discussions and transparency indicate trust in the people by an elected government. There is little evidence of that in the framing of the IT guidelines. Now, we even have the Government™s draft on the proposed amendments to the Cinematograph Act of 1952 , seek- ing to control the Central Board of Film Certi“cation ™s power of certi“cation! anuradha.r@thehindu.co.in Framing the legislation, forgetting thetransparency India, it appears, is charting a regulatory framework without discussion and openness, andwith government overreach GETTY IMAGES/ISTOCKPHOTO The Indian Constitution may face an unprecedented crisis in 2026 when there will be a dramatic change in the composi- tion of the Lok Sabha. Since 1976, seats in the Lok Sabha have re‘ect- ed the 1971 census and have not ta- ken into account changes in the population. The primary reason for this has been unequal popula- tion growth among S tates. India™s most highly developed and prosperous S tates have been suc- cessful at family planning, while the poorer States continue to ex- pand. The freeze was thus a chance to ensure that India™s most successful S tates are not punished politically for their success. Post 2026, when this compact ends, there will be a seismic shift in na- tional power towards India™s poor- est and most populated S tates, which is sure to generate much re- sentment among the S tates that will lose political and economic power and in‘uence. This calls for arealignment in the balance bet- ween the democratic principle and the federal principle in the In- dian Constitution.  The essence of the Union As Article 1 of the Indian Constitu- tion says, India is a Union of S tates. The choice of words is deliberate: it is the several States that, togeth- er, make up the Indian Union. Ad- mittedly, unlike in other federa- tions, there is no separate S tate citizenship or State C onstitutions. However, one need only study the history that led up to the linguistic reorganisation of States in 1956, and to subsequent movements for Statehood afterwards, to under- stand that S tates are distinct asso- ciative communities, within the federal structure of the Indian Un- ion. Indeed, in a polity as plural as ours Œ linguistically, culturally, and ethnically Œ it could not be any oth- er way. Big versus small States Having established, thus, that States are important, self-con- tained units within the Indian con- stitutional scheme, we must turn to an inherent contradiction bet- ween the principles of democracy and federalism, when federal units are unequal in size, population and economics. This is easy to comprehend. In a democratic set up, all citizens are equal and are thus entitled to equal representa- tion in governance. But this would imply that bigger States are likely to dominate the national conversa- tion over smaller S tates. Small States fear that they would get a smaller share of the pie economi- cally, a much reduced say in na- tional issues, and be irrelevant in the political governance of the country. In order to assuage this legiti- mate fear, federal democracies have incorporated into their go- verning structures various kinds of compromises to ensure a balance between democratic principles and federal ones. For example, when the Ameri- cans adopted their Constitution, they protected smaller States in four ways. First, national powers over the S tates were limited. Se- cond, each State regardless of size had two seats in the S enate, giving smaller S tates an outsized role in national governance. Third , Presi- dents are elected by electoral votes, which means they must win States rather than the total nation- al population. Fourth , and deplor- ably, the slave-owning S tates which did not confer citizenship on slaves were allowed to count the slaves for purposes of repre- sentation, with each slave being counted as three-“fths of a person. This essential structure remains the bedrock of the American Con- stitution today, though the Ameri- cans have rid themselves of slav- ery (fortunately) and have dramatically increased the scope of federal intervention. This feder- al structure has led to the severing of causational links between the national vote and presidential elections. Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump won without winning the popular vote.  The current movement to re- move the power of a minority to “- libuster legislation is based on de- mocratic principles  seeking to mitigate the pathology of exces- sive federalism: indeed, the Amer- ican structures of government go so far in the other direction, that they have been accused of essen- tially facilitating and entrenching minority rule through the Senate, which favours rural, sparsely pop- ulated S tates that are also predo- minantly white. The Indian structure Other federations (Switzerland and Belgiumcome to mind) have adopted other Š less extreme Š forms of reconciliation. However, India™s quasi-federal structure has always been  sui generis . Our foun- ders knew that India™s diversity made federalism inevitable, but, fearing “ssiparous tendencies among S tates that had never been asingle political unit, they also created a strong centre. While his- tory has been chequered , the fears for Indian national unity simply on the basis of giving S tates greater powers have proven to be un- founded Š and if at all, it has been the other way. The 1956 reorgani- sation of States on linguistic lines was a popular recognition of fed- eral principles and yet did not re- sult in separatist tendencies. Since then, new S tates within the Union have been created in response to the demands of people for greater autonomy.  In India, any clash between fed- eral principles and democracy will inevitably also have linguistic, reli- gious and cultural implications and may result in new forms of sub-regional chauvinism. Thus, there is an urgent need to reima- gine our national compact Š another freeze will only kick this thorny issue down the road and will continue to perpetuate an in- creasingly undemocratic set up.  Fine-tune these elements  We have the components of such a new balance that need to be “ne- tuned to Indian realities. First, the powers of States  vis-à-vis the Centre contained in the Lists and in the provisions dealing with al- tering boundaries of S tates must be increased to assuage the fear of smaller S tates that they will be dominated by bigger ones. There is no reason to believe that empo- wering our States would cause na- tional disintegration. On the con- trary, more localised decision-making is bound to in- crease national prosperity. In- deed, this was the entire goal of the creation of Panchayat gover- nance through the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution, whose promise remains Š  unfortu- nately Š unrealised. Second, the role and composi- tion of the Rajya Sabha, our H ouse of States, must be expanded. This would allow smaller S tates a kind of brake over national majoritar- ian politics that adversely impact them.  Third , constitutional change and the change in “nancial redis- tribution between the States must require the consent of all or nearly all States (the fate of the Goods and Services Tax, or GST, serves as asalutary warning in this regard). Constitutional provisions dealing with language and religion must also be inviolate. If India is a joint venture between majority and mi- nority shareholders, the minority must be protected by a compre- hensive list of ﬁconsensus itemsﬂ that require unanimity Š or at least, a super-majority Š and not simple majority.  Fourth , serious thought must be given to breaking up the biggest States into smaller units that will not  by themselves dominate the national conversation. Competing claims The unity of India is, of course, the fundamental premise underlying this discussion; but this unity does not depend on an overbearing Centre for its survival. National bonds of a†ection and patriotism will not be severed by devolution of powers though they will be at least severely strained when one part of the country is empowered over another. Lampedusa™s  Il Gat- topardo contains the memorable quote, Everything must change for everything to remain the same .This includes the question of how we are to balance the competing claims of democracy and federal- ism, in the years to come.

Teams wrestling  with their pasts before swimming to- wards the light make for compelling plotlines. But for giant footballing countries, success following failure is more of a sequence and less of a narrative. This mil- lennium, Germany and France have plumbed the depths before rising to become world champions. But Italy™s redemption story at Wembley on Sunday, a pe- nalty shoot-out victory over England to secure only  its second-ever European Championship, should not be seen through such a reductionist lens. The triumph re- presents the transformation of a proud, but dogmatic ,footballing nation into a modern, forward-looking side, with the singular aim of coming out of one of its darkest chapters Šof not qualifying for a World Cup (2018) for the “rst time since 1958 . In the process, Roberto Manci- ni™s out“t also cleared the fog that had settled ove r in- ternational football. Built around the mid“eld abili ties of Jorginho, Marco Verratti and Lorenzo Insigne, and the pace and drive of Federico Chiesa and Leonardo Spinazzola, Italy played with verve. Veteran defende rs Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci ensured it  alsodisplayed old-school nous. Together with the goal-keep- ing brilliance of Gianluigi Donnarumma Š  player of the tournament Š  the  Azzurri beat No.1 ranked Belgium, No.6 Spain and No.4 England back-to-back to claim their “rst major trophy since the 2006 World Cup. Italy, no doubt, had a generation of players schooled in progressive methods since their youth, but Mancini™s tactical acumen stood out. The 56-year-old™s handlin gof the loss of key personnel was smart, as was his role in shaping Italy™s response after England went a goal ahead and threatened to end its own trophy drought of 55 years. In contrast, Germany su†ered under outgoing coach Joachim Low™s defunct ideas, while a complacent France blew a 3-1 lead against Switzerland and crashed out . Luis Enrique™s Spain, though, impressed, despite falling to Italy over penalties in the last four. Barcelona™s Pedri proved a gem and the 18-year-old mid“elder was duly named the young player of the tournament. Cris- tiano Ronaldo won the Golden Boot (5 goals, 1 assist )but was far from the driving force he usually is for Por- tugal, the 2016 winner. Denmark, by reaching the sem- i“nal despite the traumatic  exit of Christian Eriksen, showcased its collective spirit. The only discordant notes in an otherwise excellent competition were  En- glish fans™ violent behaviour  on the “nal day and the ra- cist attacks on players who erred in the  penalty shoot- out. But in the long run, Euro 2020 will be remembered for restoring Italian football, reinvigorating internation- al football and proving mildly therapeutic to  fans world- wide amidst an unending, exhausting pandemic. Redemption road Despite the violence of English fans, Euro 2020 will be remembered for good football Incentives and penalties form an integral component of the measures to  control population growth, an- nounced by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adi- tyanath on Sunday. These steps are aimed at reducing U.P.™s total fertility rate (TFR), recorded as 2.7 by the Na- tional Family Health Survey-4 in 2016, a “gure only  low- er than that of neighbouring Bihar (3.1 as of 2020 in NFHS-5) . Aims in this direction Š increasing the rate of modern contraceptive prevalence, male contraception, decreasing maternal mortality and infant mortality rates signi“cantly by 2026 Š are, on the face of it, in line with what was stressed  at the Cairo International Confe- rence on Population and Development in 1994. The Cai- ro Consensus called for a promotion of reproductive rights, empowering women, universal education, ma- ternal and infant health  to untangle the knotty issue of poverty and high fertility. But rather than taking  steps in this direction, the Government seems to have take nthe beaten path of a mixture of incentives and penalties to tackle what is a socio-economic issue as a demo- graphic one. In a draft  Uttar Pradesh Population (Con- trol, Stabilisation and Welfare) Bill, 2021, the G overn- ment aims to incentivise one-child families and reward those with two children with perks in government schemes, rebates in taxes and loans, and cash awards if family planning is done among other sops. Disincen- tives for those with more than two children include de- nial of subsidies and welfare bene“ts, a bar on  applying for government jobs and taking part in local  elections. Assam, also led by the BJP, is mulling a similar policy. The incentives/disincentives approach has been  de- nounced in the past by the National Human Rights Commission after such measures were introduced by several States in the 1990s and 2000s, i.e., Haryana, un- divided Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. The  Supreme Court, in 2003, upheld a Haryana government law barring persons with more than two children from contesting local bo -dy polls, but the legal grounding of the moves impin g- ing upon the informed choice of the individual re- mained questionable. Empirical studies of  coercive measures have shown their  discrimination against mar- ginalised people in particular and with no discernib le e†ect on population control, while  more substantive poverty reduction schemes and economic reforms have raised labour productivity and employment op- portunities,  allowed families to empower women, and reduced fertility rates as rational choices. India™s  TFRs have been reducing substantially across most States, even in  U.P. and Bihar with the highest TFRs. To hasten the drop to replacement levels of fertility, States should tackle the socio-economic issues confronting India™s largely youthful demography rather than seeking neo- Malthusian approaches on population control.

Chakkarai Chettiar, E.L. Iyer and Kalyanasundara Mudaliar for the purpose of buying and distributing 500 charkas and cotton among the labourers now on strike and of taking over and dispos- ing of the yarn produced from time to time and that the amount be recovered by the end of the year without interest. It was also resolved that in view of the acute labour sit- uation requiring the presence of leaders and workers in the city and of other circum- stances the present existing Provincial Con- gress Committee be respected to adjourn to alater day the †rst meeting of the new Pro- vincial Congress Committee announced to take place in Trichinopoly on Sunday next. The proposals of the Sub-Committees of the Council in respect of the boycott of foreign cloth, introduction of charkas throughout the city, the anti-drink and anti-untouchabil- ity campaign will be considered at the ad- journed meeting of the Council next Satur- day. AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 14, 1921 Madras Congress District Council The provisional estimates of annual national income (2020-21), released on May 31 by the National Statistical O“ce , did not have any surprises, but for one, that is, there is nothing encouraging in the numbers.  The agriculture sector continued its impressive growth performance, reiterating that it still remains as the vital sector of the economy, especial- ly at times of crisis. The manufactur- ing sector continued its subdued growth performance, failing to emerge as the growth driver, with production interruptions due to lo- calised lockdowns to be blamed. The contraction in trade (-18.2%), con- struction (-8.6%), mining (-8.5%) and manufacturing (-7.2%) is a matter of concern as these sectors account for the bulk of  low-skilled jobs. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at Constant (2011-12) Prices in Q4 of 2020-21 is showing a growth of 1.6% , slightly better than expected, but for a pe- riod when the restrictions on mobili- ty and economic activity witnessed reduction, this performance looks below par . Further, this growth, which is an improvement over the 0.5% rate of growth in the previous quarter, is a statistical artefact as it is not devoid of the base e‘ect and sea- sonality which plagues quarterly es- timates. The magnitude of contrac- tion in the economy and the policy responses towards it raises an impor- tant issue, that is, the question of growth prospects for the next year. Rising unemployment rate Contextualising the current growth rates in terms of some other macroe- conomic data would provide us a bet- ter perspective on growth recovery. First, the unemployment data re- leased by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) which says, ﬁIn May 2021, India™s labour partici- pation rate at 40 per cent was the same as it was in April 2021. But, the unemployment rate shot up to 11.9 per cent from 8 per cent in April. A stable labour participation rate com- bined with a higher unemployment rate implies a loss of jobs and a fall in the employment rate. The employ- ment rate fell to 35.3 per cent in May 2021 from 36.8 per cent in April 2021. This is a very sharp fall for a single month... May 2021 was therefore a particularly stressful month on the jobs frontﬂ. According to CMIE, over 15 million jobs were lost in May 2021, higher than the 12.3 million in No- vember 2016, the month of demone- tisation. May 2021 was also the fourth consecutive month of a fall in em- ployment. The more worrying fact is that the cumulative fall in employ- ment since January 2021 is 25.3 mil- lion of which 22.7 million were in the †rst quarter of FY 2021-2022 , that is, during April and May. This shows that the second wave of the pandem- ic has already dented economic ac- tivities, postponing  recovery further. The job losses also bring out the high informality and vulnerability of la- bour in India as of the total jobs lost during April-May, 17.2 million were of daily wage earners. Elementary textbook economics tells us that employment and aggre- gate demand in an economy are re- lated via the channel of disposable incomes of workers. We also know that aggregate demand and output growth have a positive correlation. Hence, the prospects of growth reviv- al in the next year look bleak at the moment and from this perspective, it is worrying that in just April and May 2021, India lost 25 million non-farm jobs.  Low business con†dence  This gets re’ected in the business con†dence of Indian companies, which is the second important data point that needs to examined. Busi- ness con†dence index (BCI), from the survey by the industry body FIC- CI, plummeted to 51.5 from 74.2 in the previous round. The survey also highlights the weak demand condi- tions in the economy. It says,  ﬁWith household income being severely im- pacted and past savings being alrea- dy drawn on during the †rst wave of infections, demand conditions can be expected to remain weak for lon- ger.ﬂ Compounding this is the uncer- tainty arising out of the imposition of localised curbs due to the second wave of infections and a muddled vaccine policy in the country.  Manufacturing Purchasing Manag- ers™ Index (PMI) also throws some light on the shape of things to come. PMI has slipped to a 10-month low in- dicating that the manufacturing sec- tor is showing signs of strain with growth projections being revised lower. Both BCI and PMI slipping down indicates that the overall opti- mism towards 2021-22 is low, which could impact investments and cause further job losses. Demand recovery Growth recovery depends on de- mand recovery. External demand looks robust as India™s exports touched $32 billion in May 2021, 67% higher than in May 2020 and 8% more than in May 2019. The com- bined increase in exports of April and May 2021 is over 12% indicating that global demand rebound is much faster than the domestic demand. Stimulus programmes and a sharp decline in COVID-19 infections seem to be aiding these economies. What needs to be addressed immediately is the crisis of low domestic demand.  Since last year, the policy respons- es have been to rely on credit easing, focusing more on supply side mea- sures, with more and more guaran- tees by the government to improve ’ow of credit to important sectors. There has been less direct action by the government to support the vul- nerable to alleviate their hardships. There were some sector-speci†c measures to alleviate distress in cer- tain sectors, which were timely. Ho- wever, this policy stance is unlikely to prop up growth for three reasons. First, the bulk of the policy mea- sures, including the most recent, are supply side measures and not on the demand side. In times of †nancial an- xiety, what is needed is direct state spending for a quick demand boost. Second, large parts of all the stimulus packages announced till now would work only in the medium term. These include policies related to the external sector, infrastructure and manufacturing sector. In fact, some of the policies towards agriculture, such as productivity enhancement through the introduction of new va- rieties, will only work over years. Third, the use of credit backstops as the main plank of policy has limits compared to any direct measure on the demand side as this could result in poor growth performance if priv- ate investments do not pick up. Further, the credit easing approach would take a longer time to multiply incomes as lending involves a len- der™s discretion and borrower™s obli- gation. Interestingly, a tight-†sted †s- cal policy approach comes at a time when conventional †scal stimulus packages might not be enough as supply side issues arising out of epi- sodic lockdowns need to be ad- dressed simultaneously. What is required now is a sharp re- vival in overall demand. Focusing on short-term magni†ed growth rates resting on low bases might be erro- neous, as income levels matter more than growth rates at this juncture. Focusing on growth rates has its me- rits in the long term as achieving higher income levels require sus- tained growth for longer periods. Bangladesh seems to be doing this without much fanfare, but the quest for sustained higher growth has been elusive for India for the last †ve years. M. Suresh Babu is Professor of Economics at IIT Madras. Views are personal India needs a sharp revival of demand for which higher per capita incomes are necessary Growth matters but income levels matter more M. Suresh Babu GIRI KVSNot very long ago, family planning dominat- ed health system allocations and priorities in India and resulted in much harassment  for grassroots health workers and the rural folk. It turned into a target-chasing, at times com- pulsive, exercise . The corollary was the un- dermining of trust in the public health sys- tem, which would often lead to people avoiding contact with health facilities for routine health services. Meeting targets  Such trust is indispensable for large public health programmes to function optimally, particularly in cases like COVID-19 vaccina- tion .  But the primeval tendencies of the In- dian public health system often  antagonise such trust. These  tendencies entail that a pu- blic health problem is seen merely as a func- tion of input de†ciencies, which can be over- come by pouring in more resources, manpower, and  policies. The rich processes involved in translating these inputs into out- comes, which are deeply entwined with lo- cal contexts, are largely dismissed. They also result in benevolent objectives turning into ruthless targets which are to be met at all costs and reduce subtle activities like com- munity sensitisation into  simplistic informa- tion-education-communication  exercises. There is every reason to expect these pri- meval tendencies to kick in and play foul in the COVID-19 vaccination drive.  There are signs of vaccine hesitancy in India.  Crucial junctures like a pandemic provide a window for communities to express distrust of other- wise long-established interventions like vac- cines. For the government, failing to act with †nesse in such situations could produce spil- lovers into the post-pandemic period and af- fect normal routine immunisation. More im- portantly, a desperate and overbearing approach to ensuring vaccination, coupled with de†cient trust among communities, can lead to avoidance of public health facilities by many, which could be disastrous .Further, there are certain factors that make us particularly vulnerable to the peril of vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic. While routine immunisation is well-en- trenched , COVID-19 vaccines are prone to suspicion as they are new and abrupt en- trants .  The unprecedented scale and speed of their roll-out, and the  media reporting of adverse events that are often spurious, add to the suspicion. One of the biggest neutralis- ers of vaccine distrust are the visible im- provements in disease prevention, and  the equally visible damages when communities reject vaccines. These are unlikely to work substantially in the immediate term. The emergence of newer variants which predis- pose to vaccine failure and breakthrough in- fections can also endanger trust. Such crises also provide opportunities for traditional and folk medical practitioners to reassert themselves by attempting to discre- dit modern medical principles . These practi- tioners constitute in’uential hubs within many communities that may make or break apublic health programme. Further,  certain factors could  prompt our public health sys- tem to regress to an instinctive top-down ap- proach driven by desperation, including an imminent third wave, an anticipated in- crease in vaccine supplies in the near term, and the pressure to vaccinate as many as possible in the shortest time.  Vaccine hesi- tancy may not necessarily emanate from a distrust of science but from  government mo- tives which may be miscommunicated. Acting prudently Apart from community involvement, contex- tualised action, and transparency, elo- quence and responsibility in public commu- nication, the  government should rein in an instinct of regressing into ‚target mode™  even at the highest moment of desperation. This is necessary, though not su“cient, to safe- guard public trust and prevent community alienation.  There is a need of active thinking on ave- nues to incentivise vaccination beyond pecu- niary subsidies, particularly for the rural sec- tions. This would include removing disincentives that accompany reduced phys- ical access, overenthusiastic drives on cer- tain days that result in subsequent shortages, etc. Given that more than 38 crore vaccine doses have already been administered , there is a case for disseminating  success stories through locally appropriate media, while not cutting back on honest, solemn and tactful reportage on adverse events. Positive messages and reinforcements for vaccination have to be aired from  the several quarters that command respect and trust of the community. In this regard, there is a strong case for engaging with  members of traditional and folk systems despite any po- tential resistance from them. Lastly, there is astrong case for e‘ectively utilising the ser- vices of social science professionals . They may have a pivotal role in navigating the ma- ny nuances involved in community mobilisa- tion that are often invisible to medical pro- fessionals and other technocrats. Soham D.

The PUCL said that 1,307 cases had been registered since 2015 across  States and therefore the Court must issue guidelines against the re- gistering of FIRs by the police under this head.  In 2015, the Supreme Court had declared Section 66A of the IT Act, which made online posting of infor- mation considered as ﬁgrossly o‘en- siveﬂ a crime punishable by jail, as being  violative of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and not saved under the ambit of reasonable restrictions de†ned in Article 19(2). It had  also said that the expressions used in Sec- tion 66A were  open-ended,  unde- †ned and therefore arbitrary.  In 1983, the Court had struck down Section 303 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which provided capital punishment for murder by a person serving a life term in another case,  asbeing unconstitutional. In  Mithu v. State of Punjab,  it heldthat the pun- ishment was not based on rational principle as no judicial discretion was available to a life convict. In  2018 (Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of In- dia ), the Court read down Section 377 of the IPC criminalising ﬁunnatu- ral sexﬂ as being  unconstitutional. Si- milarly, in  Joseph Shine v. Union of India(2018), the Court held adultery as de†ned under Section 497 of the IPC as being  manifestly arbitrary, dis- criminatory and violative of the dig- nity of a woman and therefore, unconstitutional. Negligence by the police  Undoubtedly, the registration of FIRs by the police under these sections is illegal and violative of the  Court™s di- rections. Though such cases may not always be  registered intentionally, negligence by Station House O“cers (SHOs) must be nipped in the bud. The supervisory police o“cers at the sub-divisional level must ensure that such sections, if invoked due to lack of knowledge at the police station  le-vel, are removed at the earliest. The Superintendents of Police  must †x responsibility on the erring o“cer and take corrective action . Everyone responsible for the negligence should not only be answerable to the courts for contempt but also be liable for  de-partmental action. If the SHOs and others don™t mend their ways despite reprimands, their annual con†den- tial reports could be dented with ad- verse entries. Action can also be in- itiated under the new Section 166A of the IPC which provides punishment for up to two years for disobeying di- rections under the law.  Avoiding registration  The best way to avoid registration of o‘ences under sections held uncon- stitutional is to educate police o“c- ers of all ranks about such provisions in basic training institutes. Second, as the Attorney General of India,  K.K. Venugopal, had suggested, there could be a mention in  brackets near the provision that the provision has been struck down, so that FIRs are not registered under those sections. Third,  unconstitutional sections of the IPC can be disabled in the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) . Most States regis- ter FIRs in the CCTNS either on a real- time basis or in ošine mode and syn- chronise this data with the State Data Centre as soon as connectivity is res- tored. In case police stations don™t have  connectivity, the data (i.e., FIR in electronic format) are taken to the nearest police station that has con- nectivity and uploaded. The CCTNS came in  handy when the Supreme Court directed the States in 2016 to upload FIRs on o“cial websites with- in 24 to 72 hours of registration.  In Chhattisgarh, we have  disabled these Sections in the system. Other States could follow  suit. The  police must ensure that no FIR is registered under unconstitutional sections and no one is harassed for the negligent actions of  SHOs.R.K. Vij is a senior IPS o†cer in Chhattisgarh.

Vij The Union Irrigation and Power Minister, Dr. K.L. Rao, told the Lok Sabha to-day [New Delhi, July 13] that the Government had in- vited a team of United Nations experts to ad- vise on the feasibility of undertaking the 2,000 mile long grand feeder canal from Patna to Tamil Nadu linking the Ganga and the Cauvery. Replying to Mr. N.K. Sanghi, the Minister said the Government™s request had been registered with the U.N. and the expert team would commence its work in about three or four months™ time. After the team™s advice, the Government would make de- tailed investigations for determining the feasibility of the project. Preliminary stu- dies, he said, indicated that monsoon water in the Ganga near Patna could be transferred to other areas in the country where there was great demand for additional irrigation, by a combination of pumped and gravity ca- nals making use of natural water courses and existing or proposed reservoirs, whe- reever practicable.
