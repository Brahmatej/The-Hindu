While quite a few of those shown the doorwere undoubtedly non-performers, performance alone does not seem to have been the criterion that in†uenced the Prime Minister™s mind. Non-performing  Ministers continue in the cabinet, the most noticeable being the Finance Minister. Also, can the Prime Minister take credit for success in managing the pandemic while sacking the Ministers concerned for their incompetence? The Prime Minister alone has to answer this apparent contradiction. He has also deviated from his oft-repeated doctrine :minimum government-maximum governance, given the mega-sized cabinet. S.K. Choudhury, BengalurunThe Prime Minister  hastargeted non-performance with the removal of key senior Ministers who probably basked in the glory of invincibility. India now has amore inclusive Council of Ministers . Hopefully the inexperience of the new Ministers will give direction to new ideas to realise Mr. Narendra Modi™s vision. Kanak Rajan Nambiar, Varam, Kannur, Kerala nAcabinet expansion in the middle of the Government™s second termhas surprised many . That high-pro“le Ministers who have played a key role since the beginning of the NDA™s rule, have now lost their jobs is intriguing. The Government has also tried to send the right signals in its representation to the educated, the young, women and the socially disadvantaged . But in the team where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the sole leader, the fact is there will hardly be any di‘erence in functioning with the new formations. Dr. D.V.G.Sankararao, Nellimarla, Andhra Pradesh nIn what can be termed a bold initiative and well-timed move, the reshu’e will augur well for the nation.

As reported by the thespian later, during the Kargil war, he was under pressure to return it. His meeting with then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to seek his advice was the turning point Mr. Vajpayee declared: ﬁThere is no doubt about Dilip™s patriotism and commitment to nation...  He has received the Award at an individual level. It™s his will to keep it or return it. No one can pressurise him.ﬂ This it was an occasion when even his opponent could not believe his eyes.For millions of his fans the world over, the immediate reaction was whether this would spell his retirement.

To read more letters online, scan the QR code Chitrangada Choudhury When an ošcer from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) came to in- terrogate Father Stan Swamy last monsoon, the  Jesuit sociologist, then 83, in turn asked him about police integrity, and why a father- son duo (P. Jayaraj and Bennicks) should die of custodial torture in a Tamil Nadu  police lock-up. It was quintessential Fr. Swamy: un- afraid, outspoken, and question- ing injustice. Fr. Swamy was sent to Taloja Jail in October 2020 in the Bhima Ko- regaon case, where some of his co- accused have now spent more than three years without bail or trial. All have been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Preven- tion) Act (UAPA), a widely misused tool for governments to criminal- ise lawful dissent and hold ideo- logical opponents in prolonged in- carceration. For all the talk by authorities of a terrorist conspira- cy, Fr. Swamy was never interro- gated in nine months of custody. His arrest in the middle of the pan- demic, over two years after the “rst raid on his spartan one-room residence, seems like targeted viciousness. All Indians have dignity, not just the wealthy and the privileged. This belief guided Fr. Swamy ™s life- long concern for justice, as I saw in my interactions with him over the years as a journalist.  Adivasis and loss When he “rst came to West Singhbhum from his native Tiru- chirappalli in Tamil Nadu in the 1970s, living among the Adivasi communities profoundly shaped him. He had told me in an inter- view, ﬁI underwent an awakening, looking at Adivasi values of equali- ty, community, and decision-mak- ing by consensus.ﬂ His work “rmly rejected the prejudice of Adivasi ‚backwardness™, and tirelessly pointed out how violence and dis- possession was pushed down their throats and called development: ﬁAdivasis lived on lands full of min- erals. Others took these out and enriched themselves, but Adivasis did not get anything.ﬂ In a decade-long tenure as Di- rector of Bengaluru™s Indian Social Institute, he trained countless grass-roots activists. He continued this work when he co-founded the Ranchi-based Bagaicha in 2006 Š acentre for research, training and social action dedicated to working with Adivasi and other marginal- ised communities and legally em- powering their struggles for jus- tice and dignity. As long-time friends and colleagues testify, Fr. Swamy wanted it to be a place which the marginalised felt was their own. A statue of Birsa Munda and a megalith with the names of those killed in anti-displacement protests marked Bagaicha™s cen- tral ground. Its one room library contained reports, studies and “les of newspaper cuttings on is- sues such as  forced displacement, hunger deaths, extra-judicial kill- ings and grassroots protests Š a buried history of India™s democracy. Helping hand for undertrials When I “rst met Fr. Swamy in 2013, his team was immersed in ef- forts for poor undertrials in pri- sons across Jharkhand against a raging armed con†ict.  After three years of painstaking research based on prison visits, meeting police ošcials and villagers, and Right to Information Act requests, his team released a report that in- cluded the case studies of over 100 UAPA undertrials. Overwhelming- ly, they were Adivasis and Dalits, and in some cases they had lan- guished in the criminal justice sys- tem for up to 10 years. About 59% of the households of undertrials, the report found, earned under 3,000 per month and were forced to sell assets such as goats to meet bail conditions or legal ex- penses. Fr. Swamy also “led a pu- blic interest litigation on the basis of his team™s “ndings, which is still being heard in the Jharkhand High Court. As he publicly stated before his arrest, he believed that such ef- forts to challenge an unjust status quo led the state to target him. Fr. Swamy™s demise has led to a public outpouring of sadness and anger at the cruelty of our crimi- nal justice system. Ever self-e‘ac- ing, he would have wanted this at- tention not on him but on the resource grabs that continue to in- †ict  staggering violence against Adivasis and other marginalis ed groups, “ll our prisons with peo- ple with little access to justice, and necessitate draconian laws such as the UAPA. To blame ‚the system™ or ‚the government™ for his death is to overlook how we are implicat- ed in this political economy found- ed on dispossession, and the ever- expanding criminalisation of de- mands for social and environmental justice as conspira- cies against the state.  Liberalisation, the oppressed The human rights activist, K. Bala- gopal, had argued that an abiding legacy of liberalisation is the deleg- itimis ation of concern for the op- pressed. This is why a man who strove all his life for solidarity, fra- ternity and justice in real terms stands accused by our government of promoting enmity. And why his death, while foretold, transcends textual analyses of the UAPA, cour- troom proceedings and prison reforms. Fr. Swamy had one chance to appear in court, when a Bombay High Court B ench asked for him to be presented via video-conferenc- ing from Taloja jail on the after- noon of  May 21. Battling multiple ailments including Parkinson™s dis- ease, diminished hearing, and by then COVID-19contracted in pri- son, he  was visibly ailing, but as al- ways full of self-respect.  He told the court that prison conditions were steadily destroy- ing his abilities to read, write and walk, and that he be granted bail to return to Ranchi to be with his own. In rejecting the judges™ sug- gestion that they send him to hos- pital for a few days, Fr. Swamy as-serted his dignity and innocence, and registered a moral protest against being e‘ectively made to serve a death sentence, as an inde- “nitely imprisoned undertrial. As now well known, a dying man™s “nal wish to return to Jhark- hand, to the people he loved and with whose struggles he had be- come one for over “ve decades, went unheard. These struggles will keep Father Stan Swamy™s quest for a more democratic India alive.

A familiar air of uncer- tainty surrounds Kabul as the Af- ghans ponder over the future of their land, ravaged by con†ict for nearly 50 years. Afghanistan™s im- mediate neighbours are now faced with a new challenge Š how to per- suade the Taliban against over- playing their military hand? Acostly misadventure Could anyone have predicted when the U.S. commenced its mil- itary intervention in Afghanistan in October 2001 that it would get embroiled in an endless war for 20 years and to exit safely, it would have to negotiate with the Taliban, the same entity that it went in to punish?  It has been a costly lesson. The war e‘ort has cost $980 billion, over 2,400 U.S. soldiers (plus 1,144 allied troops) and 388 private mili- tary contractors have lost their lives. It also spent $143 billion on reconstruction; about $90 billion went for the Afghan army, police and other security forces, $36 bil- lion for governance and economic development activities (the rest of the international community con- tributed an equivalent amount) and the balance on counter-nar- cotics and humanitarian relief works (https://bit.ly/3ADTcP7). Yet, the real price has been paid by the Afghans. The 20-year war has claimed the lives of nearly 50,000 Afghan civilians and near- ly 70,000 Afghan security forces (a majority during the last seven years); add to it another 60,000 Afghan Taliban, and the scale of the Afghan human loss becomes evident.  There have been gains too. In 2001, there were 9,00,000 boys in school. Today, eight million chil- dren attend school and a  third are girls. Literacy is up from 12% in 2002 to 35%; life expectancy from 40 to 63 years. Urbanisation is 26% and 70% of the population watch TV. From 320 miles of paved roads in 2002, today, tarred roads cover 10,000 miles. Infant mortality rates are down from 20% by over half. With a median age of 18.5 years, a majority of Af- ghans have grown up in a post-Ta- liban era. Today, they bear the brunt of 130 daily Taliban/IS Kho- rasan (IS-K)attacks, the highest since the U.S. ended combat oper- ations in end-2014. Tomorrow, even these limited gains are at risk. Taliban gains legitimacy For U.S. President Bush, the objec- tive was ﬁto build a stable, strong, e‘ectively governed Afghanistan that won™t degenerate into chaosﬂ. As the U.S. shifted from counter- terrorism to counter-insurgency, shades of Vietnam began to emerge. To Hamid Karzai™s credit, he saw the writing on the wall when he protested about the night-raids and warned the Ameri- cans ﬁto either take the “ght to the safe havens and sanctuaries across the Durand Line or make peace with the Talibanﬂ but it only soured his relations with the U.S.  Eventually, U.S. President Ba- rack Obama diluted the objective to ﬁpreventing Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for global terrorismﬂ. He oversaw a success- ful operation to eliminate Osama bin Laden in 2011, implemented an unsuccessful military surge concluding with an end to combat operations in end-2014 and Tali- ban opened the Doha ošce in 2013.  U.S. President Donald Trump saw himself as a deal-maker and in 2018, initiated direct negotiations with the Taliban. Ambassador Zal- may Khalilzad (U.S. Special Repre- sentative for Afghanistan Reconci- liation) began by setting out four elements Š a cease“re, cutting ties with al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, intra-Afghan peace talks, and, a withdrawal of all foreign military forces, declaring that ﬁnothing is agreed till everything is agreedﬂ. Within months, the Ta- liban had whittled down the U.S. demands till it got what it wanted Ša withdrawal timeline not linked to the other factors. In addition, the Taliban managed to get the U.S. to push the Kabul government to releaseover 5,000 Taliban cadres in custody. In short, the U.S. ended up legitimising the Tali- ban at the expense of the govern- ment in Kabul that they had worked to create and support. U.S. President Joe Biden was no stranger to the Afghan dossier. He was convinced that the U.S. had to exit from its quagmire of ﬁforever warsﬂ. The U.S. may have decided that it had no military options but the Taliban are still pushing ahead militarily.  From less than a “fth, today, ov- er a third of Afghanistan™s over 400  districts are under Taliban control. The day after the exit from Bagram, 13 districts, in Ba- dakhshan, Takhar, Paktia and Kan- dahar fell to the Taliban, adding to the 50 that have fallen since May. In many cases, the locals manning the security posts and checkpoints have just surrendered. From vil- lages and towns, there is already a move towards the cities. Intra-Af- ghan talks in Doha have been in limbo for months. Questions about the future Gen. Austin S. Miller, the U.S. com- mander in Afghanistan, indicated in a recent press conference, ﬁCivil war is certainly a path that can be visualised if it continues on this trajectory.ﬂ Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, warned on June 30, ﬁThe truth is, today the survival, security and unity of Afghanistan is in danger....ﬂ Ironically, the most vocal critics of the U.S. overstaying in Afghanis- tan and hinting that the U.S. would never leave are the ones now blaming the U.S. for a hasty and ir- responsible withdrawal. In coming months, as uncer- tainties mount, there will be in- creasing Taliban presence in the countryside as the Kabul govern- ment concentrates on ensuring se- curity in urban areas and of the road networks. The Taliban mili- tary strategy has been to target dis- tricts that enable them to sur- round provincial capitals. The clutch in the northeast including Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunduz and Baghlan enable them to control the AfghanistanŒTajikistan border and the Wakhan corridor that links to China. In the east, they ex- ert control in Ghazni, Zabul and Paktia while the Haqqani network is active in Khost and Paktika, and the IS-K in Nangarhar, Kunar and Laghman. Further south, the Tali- ban control large parts of Kanda- har, Helmand and Farah (border- ing Iran).  As the reality of the U.S. with- drawal takes hold, how events un- fold by end-2021 depends on three factors. First, have the Taliban changed their ideological colours? The U.S. in recent years, and Pa- kistan for much longer, have been pushing this line but the Taliban leadership have given no clues about it. Related to this is the ques- tion of Taliban unity. Distances have grown between the Quetta shura, the Doha negotiators and the “ghters who want to guard their individual preserves. This works as long as everyone is pur- suing the military option, but when it comes to power sharing, who calls the shots? Or, does it lead to no power sharing?  Second, can the Kabul regime present a uni“ed front? If the lead- ers in Kabul and the government continue sniping at each other, it will adversely impact the integrity of the chain of command of the Af- ghan security forces. If opportu- nistic leaders are tempted to strike their own deals with the Taliban, it will only hasten the collapse, and even western funding will dry up.  The Pakistan factor Finally, is Pakistan still seeking strategic depth in Afghanistan or has it realised that a Taliban-dom- inated Kabul will be a magnet for its own home-grown extremists as well as those from the neighbour- hood? Can it  persuade the Taliban that its legitimacy will be at risk unless it shares power? Pakistan™s in†uence will weaken once the Rehbari Shura decides to move back from Quetta to Afghanistan.  History tells us that in Afghanis- tan, there have only been winners and losers, seldom any lasting compromises.  Rakesh Sood is a former diplomat and presently, Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation Troubling prospects in Afghanistan As the reality of the U.S. withdrawal takes hold, the future will depend on Taliban-Kabul dynamics and Pakistan™s role  Rakesh Sood REUTERSEntering its “fth year, India™s Goods and Services Tax (GST) system reported a blip in revenue col- lections for June, breaking an eight-month streak of over 1-lakh crore in tax receipts. GST revenues tanked to a tad less than93,000 crore last month Š the lowest in 10months Š after a record1.41-lakh crore in April and  a relatively tepid1.02-lakh crore in May. Gen- erally, the June revenue re†ects transactions that oc- curred in May. With the second wave of the pandemic in full †ourish and States enforcing rigorous restrictions on most activities in May, the numbers are not really surprising. However, as May GST compliance dates for smaller taxpayers were extended till early July, some of this revenue also re†ects April™s sales . Thus, the actual GST income attributable to May™s economic activity would be lower than June™s gross GST kitty. This is also re†ected in the generation of e-way bills, which fell by a sharp 30% in May compared to April, while the sequen- tial decline in revenues was not as steep. With caseloads declining over June and restrictions being pulled ba ck gradually, revenues should pick up next month with 5.5 crore e-way bills generated in June from 3.99 crore in May. Despite the slowdown in May-June, GST collec- tions in the Q1 of  2021-22  have been healthier than pre- pandemic levels, con“rming that this year™s restrictions driven by States have in†icted less economic costs than the national lockdown at a few hours™ notice, in 2020.  While the second wave setbacks have shaken up bu- siness and consumer sentiment, average monthly reve- nues of over 1-lakh crore Š which Finance Minister Nir- mala Sitharaman has termed the ‚new normal™ for GST Šcould perhaps sustain through the year, if there is no dramatic resurgence of the pandemic and vaccinations are ramped up as promised. This should give some “s- cal breathing room for the Centre and States, but neith- er can a‘ord to sit back. Structural corrections in the GST regime and the inclusion of petroleum and elec- tricity may take longer, but there is enough that needs immediate attention. Industry has sought temporary rate cuts on some sectors to spur demand. It is plausible that a volume pick-up could make up for resultant reve- nue losses, just as an uptick in petrol consumption creates room for a revenue-neutral duty cut on fuels. The GST Council must be reconvened soon to take up such ideas to prod the economy™s rebound, apart from holding the promised special session to discuss all  the brewing concerns related to States™ compensation. De- laying this will not only foster greater misgivings bet- ween the Centre and the Statesbut also make it tough for States to plan their borrowings for the rest of the year. Clarity is also needed urgently on when the 1.58-lakh crore of back-to-back borrowings for States in lieu of compensation dues will begin. If the Centre plans to raise  5,000 crore a week, like it did last year, it will take roughly 32 weeks to complete such borrowings; so, any delay beyond early August may not be viable.  A blip This year™s restrictions by States have in†icted less economic costs than the 2020 lockdown The reconstitution of the Union Council of Minis- ters on Wednesday was guided by both political and administrative considerations. As many as 36 new faces were inducted and 12 dropped from the council, which now has 78 members, just three shy of the upper limit of 81. In 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began its rule advertising its 45-member C ouncil of M inisters as an attempt at minimum government, but the restraint was quietly abandoned in the following years. The political aspirations of communities and re- gions are dišcult to satiate in a country as vast and di- verse as India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made an attempt to make his Council more diverse and repre- sentative, in a manner that “ts his political prioriti es. The new composition of the Council is in step with the BJP™s relentless e‘orts to rope in OBC groups, Dalits and tribes people under its Hindutva umbrella politics. This accommodation is crucial for the BJP to continue its do- minance in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other Hindi-speak- ing regions, where caste tensions are simmering. New inductions and elevations also signal a continued e‘ort by the BJP to expand its in†uence to new areas such as West Bengal and the northeastern States. Barring the continuing under-representation of Muslims, the coun- cil is impressively representative of Indian diversity.  Governance issues might have been a factor in the ax- ing of some of the Ministers. Harsh Vardhan, Ravi Shan- kar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar were among those who got the marching orders, apparently for mishan- dling the pandemic, relations with global IT giants and governmental communication, respectively. New in- ductees such as Ashwini Vaishnaw and Jyotiraditya Scindia have administrative skills that could prove  va- luable in crucial ministries that they now head. Ind ivi- dual talent and accountability both can only be contex- tual, and in a highly centralised system they become immaterial. The M inisters must be empowered to plan and take decisions in their respective areas. The notion of collective responsibility of the cabinet must be i n- fused with meaning. Discussions in the cabinet must be open. Proposals that come for the cabinet™s consider a- tion must go through rigorous technical vetting and wide political consultations. The recomposition was in- tended to enhance governance, rev up the economy and fuel the BJP™s political march ahead of crucial State elections and the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. All thes ewould be possible only if all hands are on the deck. As- sembling a team is indeed a crucial task of a captain; al- lowing them to †ourish as individuals while playing as a team is equally critical.

A repetition, for athird time or more, of age-long and empty platitudes is calculated only further to dee- pen the wounds and we are unable to see in the Viceroy™s speech anything more than a repetition of his favourite platitudes. The Punjab wrong, His Excellency still thinks, is to be a closed chapter not to be reopened. Sir William Vincent™s references in a dark corner of his speech to ﬁo†cial excessesﬂ whose e“ects he cleverly extenuated by drawing a lurid picture of the disturbances are considered by the Viceroy as su†cient apology for the great wrong. Such an atti- tude on the part of the Viceroy is not calcu- lated to enhance his reputation for taking a ﬁsternly justﬂ view of things. It is an abuse of language to state that the butchery at Jallian- walla and the subsequent barbarity which left wounded men in the ‘eld to the passers- by, if there were any, were mere ﬁexcesses,ﬂ comparable to the isolated excesses of the mob. It is deliberate callousness to the loss of Indian lives for which the Government have yet to answer to the people of India.

Procedural laws have the Code of Criminal Procedure as their backbone but there are other laws too, such as the Extradition Act, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Prevention of Money Laundering, and so on .Investigation and prosecution The bulk of the investigation and pro- secution work happens at police sta- tions in the States, while Central agencies take up  the important cas- es. Central agencies have developed reasonable expertise because they are focussed only on investigation and prosecution work, whereas State police forces (except  specialised wings) are engaged in law-and-order work as well as investigations.  There is a tendency to close investigations once the accused have absconded, and an overwhelming tendency to bank on statements obtained from the accused or during interrogation before closing investigations. It would be interesting to know what proportion of arrest warrants ob- tained by investigation agencies of States pertain to persons who have absconded or are ‚wanted™, whether within India or abroad. Some police stations do initiate proceedings for attachment of property and declara- tion of the accused as proclaimed of- fenders, but the number of cases where coordinated e“orts are made to pursue fugitives Œ domestically or internationally Œ are hardly docu- mented. If the number of Red Corner Notices issued are of any indication, only about 750 such criminals are wanted by Indian agencies. The num- ber of Blue Corner Notices issued is about 300. Theoretically there exists a system of tracking criminals worldwide Œ through Interpol Notices and the sharing of immigration databases of di“erent countries Œ but there is no coordinated system or database for tracking criminals or wanted persons domestically. In the absence of such asystem, it is relatively easy for cri- minals from one police station/juris- diction to  melt into the population in any other area, almost undetected. Requirements The creation of a nationwide data- base of wanted persons, which could be accessible for police agencies, the public and others (like  passport and immigration authorities), is impera- tive. The Crime and Criminal Track- ing Network and Systems and the Na- tional Intelligence Grid are e“orts in the right direction, but more integra- tion is desirable. Perhaps a nation- wide system of ‚Wanted Persons Not- ices™, similar to Interpol Notices, is required, to help track fugitives dom- estically. Countries like the U.S. have functional inter-State extradition and fugitive tracking systems; India needs to set up such dedicated ‚fugitive tracking units™. There needs to be en- hanced integration between immi- gration agencies, State police agen- cies, Interpol-New Delhi, the External A“airs Ministry and Home Ministry and central investigation agencies. Intelligence agencies  also need to pool in.  What may also help India plug loo- pholes is sharing its  ‚wanted™ data- base or providing  access to it to fo- reign embassies on a reciprocal basis or through treaties or arrangements .All this will help detect possible plans of criminals to abscond abroad. Signing of more bilateral and mul- tilateral conventions on criminal matters would help plug legal in‘r- mities. Signing bilateral agreements on cooperation in policing matters would also help.  All relevant legal processes and requirements should be incorporated into one consolidat- ed law on international cooperation. The entire gamut of activities per- taining to fugitives, from investiga- tion to extradition, needs to be incor- porated into a specialised set-up with an Integrated International Coopera- tion Division (IICD) at the top. The IICD should have linkages with pro- posed fugitive tracking units at the State level. This would ensure that re- quisite expertise and forward-and- backward linkages are created.  Mak- ing systems watertight would  deter criminals from hoodwinking the law. Rupin Sharma is an IPS o†cer Tracking fugitives everywhere In the absence of a coordinated database,  criminals can go undetected Rupin Sharma The Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, Mrs. Nandini Satpathi, in- formed the Lok Sabha to-day [New Delhi, Ju- ly 6] that the Government was considering bringing forward suitable legislation to se- cure a broader base of ownership of new- spapers having a circulation above a speci‘c minimum. Replying to the debate on the de- mands for grants of her Ministry, she said that was one of the steps contemplated by the Government to ensure freedom of the press and end monopolistic ownership of newspapers. The intention was that new- spapers with a larger circulation should be owned by a comparatively larger number of people. This indeed had been recommend- ed by the Press Commission more than 15 years ago. The proposed legislation, she said, might also provide for full disclosure of the ‘nancial interest and transactions of larger newspapers. She reiterated that the Government believed in complete and full freedom of the press.

In a con- versation moderated by  Abdus Sa- lam , M.R. Madhavan and S.Y. Qu- raishi thread through precedents and procedures as all eyes are “rm- ly “xed on the Election Commission of India (ECI)™s next moves. Edited excerpts: Should Chief Ministers be mandatorily picked from the pool of elected MLAs? Or at the very least, should a Member of Parliament resign immediately from the House if picked to lead aState? M.R. Madhavan: Let™s look at it from the ‘rst principles of how the Constitution is. We have a parlia- mentary democracy, which essen- tially means that whoever has the con‘dence of the majority of the members of the Lok Sabha, in the case of the Centre, will be the Prime Minister. It also requires that all Mi- nisters should be a Member of Par- liament (MP) or get elected within six months. Rather, it puts it in nega- tive terms. Anybody who is a Minis- ter and is not an MP for six months automatically stands to be disquali- ‘ed from the administration. It vi- sualises the Chief Minister as being elected by the members of the House of their own free will. And it assumes that the Chief Minister is a member. There are, of course, ex- ceptional circumstances, especially for Ministers. Let me mention the fairly non-controversial case of Dr. Manmohan Singh in 1991 when there was a crisis, and Prime Minis- ter P.V. Narasimha Rao wanted him as the Finance Minister. Was that for the national public good? In hind- sight, we would say yes. In the case of a Chief Minister, it becomes slightly dicey. There is a party high command, especially in the case of national parties, which decides who will become the Chief Minister. Ef- fectively you have removed the whole concept of the person being the popular choice of the elected people. So, the Chief Minister is an indirectly elected person by the di- rectly elected members. But now the Chief Minister dictates how each of those persons will  vote, because with the anti-defection law, we have weakened that accountability me- chanism drastically. What is the way out? Not very clear. The second part of your question is much clearer. If you look at va- rious other parts of the Constitu- tion, it™s clear that the Constitution expects a person not to hold  more than one constitutional position at a time. If you look at Article 101, it says that if a person is a member of both Houses of Parliament, he or she loses membership of one; if a person is an MP and gets elected as an MLA, or vice versa, he or she has about 14 days to resign from one.  When you are an MP and become the Chief Minister, you are the head of the executive of that State. So, what is your primary role? Is it to vote as a Member of Parliament? Or is it to be in the State and attend the State™s legislature and be accounta- ble to it? In that at least, we should de‘nitely amend the Constitution to say that if you are going to be the Chief Minister or a Minister of a State, you should resign your mem- bership of another House before taking up the role. That is, one should not occupy two constitution- al o†ces concurrently.  S.Y. Quraishi:  Whether it™s a good thing or a bad thing is not the issue for us to decide, because the fram- ers of the Constitution provided for this fresh air coming from outside, if need be, with the condition that within six months they need to get elected. It™s a good provision and  Ifeel we don™t need to tinker with it because it does restrict options. Of course, this option should be used intelligently and with full honesty, and not just to tinker with politics. And it should be used sparingly. So, you want the door to remain open for lateral entry. Coming speci†cally to Tirath Singh Rawat™s case, was his election as MLA a constitutional impossibility? SYQ:  He could have easily contested the election. Didn™t he anticipate that he would have to get elected in the thick of COVID-19? To say that in the time of COVID-19 it will not be advisable to conduct elections and therefore I™m resigning is a very ’imsy excuse. It is some kind of a deeper political calculation. It™s a build-up for something more se- rious, to create the precedent for West Bengal [bypolls] whereas the entire West Bengal [Assembly] elec- tion was held during COVID-19. And the Bihar election was held during COVID-19, and it was very well done. The ECI issued guidelines for CO- VID-19 before the Bihar election, which were beautiful. By then, it had the global experience of 70 countries which had conducted elections in the thick of COVID-19 and done them very well, [to learn from]. India learnt a lot from all of them, and then formulated its own guidelines. Having conducted a big- ger election, what stopped the ECI from conducting a by-election in Ut- tarakhand? My feeling is that a scene may be created where by- elections won™t be held. This should not create a precedent Š that it would be dangerous to hold a by-election. Mamata Banerjee has four months left to get elected as an MLA. Several Opposition leaders have suggested that Mr. Rawat™s case portends a similar predicament for her. Is there reason for her to worry ?MRM:  The constitutional position is clear, right? If she doesn™t get elect- ed, she can™t be the Chief Minister. It is the job of the ECI, and not of anyone else, to ensure that there is no constitutional crisis. Let™s visual- ise the general election circuit for the country. In the case of a State, the Constitution still permits stop- gap things like President™s Rule. What would you have done for  gen- eral elections if they were due this year in the middle of the pandemic? SYQ: I hope my apprehension is just an imagination and that it doesn™t turn out to be correct, be- cause the election must be held. Otherwise, there will be a constitu- tional crisis. And it will be humanly created rather than being a gift of the Constitution. After all, a huge election was conducted recently and all went well. But in  West Ben- gal,  public meetings were happen- ing. We were all expressing our con- cern then: ‚What the hell is happening? Why are you allowing such huge meetings?™ Surprisingly, the Prime Minister, instead of get- ting concerned looking at those crowds, in violation of his own gui- delines for the whole country,  was showing his excitement like a child. Those public meetings were  the on- ly undesirable thing; they should have been banned. They were  even- tually  banned, but that decision should have been taken  earlier. With the COVID-19 guidelines and their implementation ensured, there is nothing to stop the ECI  from conducting the by-election for Ma- mata Banerjee. There should be a ban on public meetings because that is the only security risk of CO- VID-19. Nobody has any reason to complain because the rules apply to all parties. Given the extraordinary circumstances of a pandemic raging since early 2020, should we as a polity be “exible on constitutional and legislative deadlines? MRM: I would say that you cannot defer the elections; you™ll have to pull them o“ in some manner.  The U.S. did that. If you say that under extraordinary circumstances, the constitutional requirement of par- liamentary elections in ‘ve years could be deferred, then you will ‘nd people ‘guring out ways to create extraordinary situations more and more often, and these situations will become ordinary. The ECI has the choice, because if an election is not held, it leads to a constitutional crisis. And the ECI™s job is to ensure that there is no con- stitutional crisis instead of creating one. Under Section 151 of the Repre- sentation of the People Act, it is pro- vided that if only one year is left of a House, a by-election will not be held. But it is actually  at the discre- tion of the ECI to make an excep- tion. And it has  been making an ex- ception only for the Chief Minister. Because in a House of 200-300, about three-four vacancies are al- ways there. The government being allowed to fall because the ECI  says it cannot hold an election... that would be the very unbecoming of the Commission. Now, in Section 151, a subsection provides that the ECI  in consultation with the Central government certify that it is di†cult to hold the by-election within the set period. I hope we don™t read into that. There™s also the question of institutional resilience. What more can be done to insulate bodies such as the ECI  from being seen as susceptible to external pressures? MRM:  There™s a legitimacy of a go- vernment being formed in a free and fair election, and everybody subscribes to that. If that legitimacy is undermined, we are in deep cri- sis. What does the legitimacy rest on? It rests on public belief and pu- blic trust in the ECI  holding free and fair elections. The ECI has been a ve- ry trusted institution for a fairly long time now. Is that public trust getting bigger or not? That™s a big question. SYQ: The ECI has a constitution de- signed for it to be insulated from the government. Which is why once ap- pointed, the Chief Election Commis- sioner cannot be removed except through impeachment. Now, there are two reforms that we have been shouting for. The Commission is ap- pointed by the government of the day without consulting the Opposi- tion. It is a di“erent matter that all the Election Commissioners ap- pointed through this route per- formed very well. And we hope that it will continue to happen. But  hopeis not a strategy, a system has to be in place. Nowhere in the world does such a situation exist. In some coun- tries, there is scrutiny by Parlia- ment. In some cases, the candidates are interviewed by Parliament. The systemic change we are pleading for is that appointments should be through a collegium. And promo- tions should be automatic, on the basis of seniority. Second, the remo- val procedure of the two Election Commissioners. They are not pro- tected, so they feel they are on pro- bation. They™re always looking over their shoulder to see if the govern- ment is happy with them or not. That fear is absolutely dangerous and disastrous. So, that protection has to be provided. Government af- ter government has not paid any heed to this extremely important and critical issue. And even the Su- preme Court has not claimed the is- sue, despite its grave importance. MRM: Today, the CBI [Central Bu- reau of Investigation] Director is ap- pointed by a committee which in- cludes the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Is the ECI far more fundamental and important an in- stitution than the head of the CBI ?Obviously, yes. This would also pro- vide greater authority to the Com- mission because appointments would be made after an agreement across political lines. The Central Information Commission is not a constitutional body, it is a statutory body, but appointments are through a collegium. The CBI is not even a constitutional or statutory body. Why do we have our priorities upside down? Should only elected legislators be eligible for chief ministership? The option provided in the Constitution should be used with honesty, not just to tinker with politics S.Y. Quraishi served as 17th Chief Election Commissioner of India from July 2010 to June 2012M.R.
