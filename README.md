The only way to battle the novel coronavirus is through complete vaccination . With lockdowns being lifted, and the threat of a third wave looming large in the backdrop of new variants, is India really prepared?  Iflessons have not been learnt from the tragic aftermath of the second wave, then it is clear that we, as a nation, have not learnt anything. In the months ahead, which will be marked by a series of festive events, allout e†orts are required  to ensure that the situation does not get out of hand.  Balasubramaniam Pavani, Secunderabad nVisuals of the su†ering during the second wave  are still fresh in our minds.  TheState and central governments should do their bit in ensuring that COVID19 appropriate behaviour is the norm. The penalties for violations can help to change the situation to some extent. The State of Uttarakhand has done well to cancel the Kanwar Yatra, which would have been another super spreader event. All types of gatherings should be curtailed by the authorities for at least six months. It is a collective responsibility to combat the pandemic especially when vaccine stocks are running low.  Dr. D.V.G. Sankararao, Nellimarla, Andhra Pradesh nThe report is  disheartening as it must be read in conjunction with the Centre™s grand plan to  fully vaccinate the country by December. The tall claims of vaccination availability have now fallen like a pack of cards. Urgent measures must be initiated by the Government , especially after the new Minister of Health has taken charge. If we need to curb the third wave, only mass vaccination can prevent an upsurge.  Dr. Jayasekharan V.P., Payyanur, Kannur, Kerala nIt is not only a shortage of vaccines but also vaccine hesitancy, especially among marginalised sections, that needsimmediate attention. The Governor of Telangana has done her bit by getting herself vaccinated at a tribal settlement. The ball has been set rolling and government o“cials must keep the momentum going. Film stars and local leaders should also take the lead .P. Satya Lakshmi, Secunderabad Back to school The writers of the  article, ﬁPrioritising school reopening on the road to recoveryﬂ (Editorial page, July 13), have marshalled solid facts on the need to reopen schools especially as, in the context of many parts of India, the prolonged shutdown has impacted the nutritional needs of  children. But a viamedia solution is needed. First, the Union government can expedite its approval for vaccination of the age group 1215.  TheGovernment can explore the possibility of giving options to parents for online learning or inperson schooling. Parents, particularly in the rural areas, may prefer inperson schooling as many of themhave to go out to work . The Government could also introduce a shift system. For example, if there are six sections in a class, three sections may be operated on arotational basis.  Onlinelearning for an inde‘nite period is clearly no substitute for inperson schooling.  Constant exposure to electronic devices can a†ect the child™s health while ﬁinhouse incarcerationﬂ may end up causing obesity and other serious health issues.

It was his performances in the 1983 World Cup that stood out. I remember his innings in the semi‘nal against England and being stunned by his outrageously imperious and dismissive ’ick for six o† the bowling of Bob Willis. More than anything else, perhaps that shot epitomised the selfbelief and con‘dence that this young team had in itself. I also recollect that just before the semi‘nal, one of the English commentators said, ﬁIndia is going to meet England in the semi‘nal and that™s a bit of luck for England.ﬂ That shot of Sharma™s was a ‘tting reply to the rather parochial observation of the commentator.

Gopal, ChennaiEV policy With Maharashtra unveiling its new Electric Vehicle (EV) policy in an attempt to go green, one can observe the similarities with the Norwegian government™s EV road map. Norway™s plugin car segment has been at the top of its game mainly because of policy incentives, tax redemptions and the role of dedicated EV NGOs. Although Maharashtra has drawn ‘ne inspiration from the same, it is crucial to note the vast di†erences in the population, area and market share between India and Norway. Hence, we must tread the EV path carefully and apply policies that are suitable to the Indian geopolitical scenario .Rujuta Ashtekar, Thane, Maharashtra LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Letters emailed to letters@thehindu.co.in must carry the full postal address and the full name or the name with initials. To read more letters online, scan the QR code Krishnan Srinivasan &  Julius Fein The British referendum ‘ve years ago was supposed to settle the United Kingdom™s historical lovehate relationship with Europe, but while the full consequences of Brexit will not be analysed  for decades, the U.K. re mains as divided as ever, and the way people voted in 2016 forms a large part of their identity. The re ferendum dominates British polit ics as the most signi‘cant event since the Second World War , re sulting in two general elections, ousting two premiers and threa tening the political geography of the U.K. Loose ends British Prime Minister Boris John son needed a rapid departure from the European Union (E U), and the Withdrawal and Trade and Cooperation Agreements of De cember 2020 were rushed through. Problems were soon ap parent. The U.K. imports 70%  of the ‘sh it consumes; the industry only contributes 0.12% of GDP and employs 0.1%of the workforce (https://bit.ly/3i7emwG), but has political traction. In May, after 60 French ‘shing boats massed to blockade Jersey over ‘shing rights, naval units from both Britain and France deployed o† Jersey, a farci cal reminder of the loose ends of Britain™s exit from the EU. Case of Northern Ireland Northern Ireland, part of the U.K. but in the E U™s single market, and therefore obliged to follow E Urules, is another case in point. The EU™s external border would be in the Irish Sea between Britain and Northern Ireland, and goods for Northern Ireland would need to be inspected there, which is politi cally untenable for the U.K . The al ternative would be that the E Uwould itself impose inspections to protect its single market and struc ture a border either on the island of Ireland or between Ireland and the E U, which are both equally unfeasible. Tensions predictably arose bet ween Britain and the E Uover the import of chilled meat products from Britain to Northern Ireland, with Britain seeking an extension of the transition arrangements from June 30 by three months. No one believes that this can be a last ing solution. It  seems Britain is questioning Brexit agreements rather than following them, while boasting about its COVID19 immu nis ation compared to the E Uand the success of the City of London in maintaining its status against hostile E Ulegislation and incen tives for banks to move to Euro pean capitals. To supporters of Brexit, it looked as if the E Uwant ed to punish Britain for leaving, if only to discourage its other mem bers from doing the same. Thus, after membership of the E Ufor al most 50 years, mutual trust is lack ing, and two versions of a rules based order are colliding. This was apparent during the G7 summit, when bilateral meetings between Mr. Johnson and E Uleaders lacked warmth. The E Uconceded the Northern Ireland postponement and persuaded its member S tates, especially France and Germany that are losing patience with Bri tain, to avoid a trade war over Brit ish sausages. Such recriminations may become a permanent feature of U.K.E Urelations as a small na tion plays a poor hand against the world™s largest trading bloc while seeking trade deals with distant countries, which even o“cial fore casts suggest will produce negligi ble bene‘ts. Scotland™s calculations In Scotland, the National Party, which seeks an exit from the U.K., has grown in popularity since the Brexit vote. Scots voted in the refe rendum by 62% against 38%to re main in the E U, but were dragged out by the overall result. For many Scots, leaving the U.K. is the clear est path back to the E U, and antici pate that among other bene‘ts, the E Uwill grant Scotland least de veloped status and subventions on the scale enjoyed by the Irish Re public. This is as much an anti Westminster stance as an e†ort to join the E Usince the chances of an independent Scotland jumping the queue of E Uapplicants and of all member States approving Scot tish membership are not great. Ne vertheless, the prospect of a breakup of the United Kingdom is of grave concern to London. Meanwhile, a vote on re uni‘cation in Ireland seems more probable now than at any time since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 which brought an uneasy peace to fratricidal factions in the North. In perspective The International Monetary Fund warned that the British economy faced a 10% GDP decline in 2020 (https://bit.ly/3raZXUs) In ‘rst quarter 2021, food and drink ex ports to the E Udeclined by nearly 50% (https://bit.ly/3yUvj41) and export of services also shrank. At least 500British companies have relocated to Europe (https:// bit.ly/3ejG746). The Brexiteers who forecast a clean break with the EU either underestimated or ignored the practical inconve niences of leaving, including the vast paperwork involved in ex porting and importing with the EU, but the success of British CO VID19 vaccination compared with the E U™s bungled e†orts has ena bled Brexiteers to claw back some ground.  In sum, most people have ac cepted Brexit though  few are satis ‘ed with the divorce settlement. No version of Brexit will satisfy everyone, and it has left the United Kingdom less united.

To achieve this, the go vernment says it will consider the enactment of a new piece of legis lation. One such law that might be on the anvil is an ominous propo sal released just days earlier by the State™s Law C ommission (https://bit.ly/3xGH2TF). Incentives and disincentives This draft law, titled the Uttar Pra desh Population (Control, Stabili sation and Welfare) Bill, 2021, seeks to provide not only a series of incentives to families that adh ere to a twochild norm, but also intends on disentitling families that breach the norm from bene ‘ts and subsidies. These recom mendations are rooted in a culture of coercion. They are also steeped in myth. Experiences from across the world demonstrate that laws of this kind simply do not work. They invariably instil an attitude of dis crimination, with a burden im posed disparately on the most vul nerable groups in society. The draft B ill echoes the U.P. go vernment™s new policy in claiming that the State™s ecological and eco nomic resources are limited. Ac cording to it, unless population growth is regulated, the S tate will be unable to guarantee the provi sion of basic rights to all citizens. It also invokes some of the now usual buzzwords: sustainable de velopment, it says, cannot be achieved without governmentim posed birthcontrol.  To these ends, the draft postu lates an array of measures. It pro mises public servants who under go sterilisation and adopt a twochild norm several bene‘ts. These include two increments during their service, subsidy to wards the purchase of a house, maternity, or paternity leave, with full salary and allowances, as the case may be, for up to 12 months, and free health care and insurance coverage for the spouse. This is as far as the ﬁincentivesﬂ go. The draft Bill also contains a list of punishments. It terms these euphemistically as ﬁdisincen tives ﬂ. A person who breaches the twochild norm will be debarred from securing the bene‘t of any governmentsponsored welfare scheme and will be disquali‘ed from applying to  any State govern ment job. Existing government employees who infringe the rule will be denied the bene‘t of pro motion. And last, transgressing in dividuals will be prohibited from contesting elections to local auth orities and bodies. Itis worth pondering over whether regulation of population is necessary at all. But assuming such regulation is a legitimate go vernmental aim, the ‘rst question that we must ask of the new propo sal is: why. After all, experiences from other S tates in India show us that there are more e“cacious and alternative measures available to control the growth of population, including processes aimed at im proving public health and access to education.  Indeed, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare con ceded as much before the Su preme Court late last year. Through an a“davit ‘led in court, the central government argued that ﬁinternational experience shows that any coercion to have a certain number of children is counterproductive and leads to demographic distortionsﬂ. The Government further con‘rmed that India was committed to its obligations under international law, including the principles con tained in the  International Confe rence on Population and Develop ment Programme of Action, 1994.  Pledge on right Foremost in those principles was a pledge from nations that they would look beyond demographic targets and focus instead on gua ranteeing a right to reproductive freedom. Since then, in India, the Supreme Court of India has recog nised this right as an inalienable promise. In  Suchita Srivastava & Anr vs Chandigarh Administration (2009), the Court found that a wo man™s freedom to make reproduc tive decisions is an integral facet of the right to personal liberty gua ranteed by Article 21. ﬁIt is impor tant,ﬂ the Court wrote, ﬁto recog nise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from procreatingﬂ. This ruling was endorsed by the Supreme Court™s ninejudge Bench verdict in  K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017). A reading of the plurality of opinions there shows us that the Constitution sees a person™s autonomy over her body as an extension of the right to privacy. In his judgment, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud held that priva cy partakes di†erent connota tions. These include decisional au tonomy, which comprehends, among other things, liberty over ﬁintimate personal choices such as those governing reproductionﬂ. Justice S.K. Kaul similarly declared in his separate judgment that the right to procreation was an impor tant constituent of ﬁthe privacy of the homeﬂ.  Like all other fundamental rights, the right to privacy is not boundless. But, as  Puttaswamy clari‘es, any restriction placed on the right must conform to a doc trine of proportionality. This re quires ‘rst, that the limitation be rooted in statute; second, that the state show us that the objective of its law is founded on a legitimate governmental aim; third that there are no alternative and less intru sive measures available to achieve the same objective; and fourth, that there exists a rational connec tion between the limitation im posed and the aims of the statute. The logic here is simple: in pursu ing public interest, it is essential that governments ensure that indi vidual liberties are encroached upon to the lowest degree possi ble. A simple reading of U.P.™s draft law will show us that, if enacted, it will grossly impinge on the right to reproductive freedom. The go vernment will likely argue that there is no violation of privacy here because any decision on ste rilisation would be voluntary. But, as we ought to by now know, mak ing welfare conditional is a hall mark of coercion. If we want the idea of India as a welfare state to mean something, the right to ac cess basic goods cannot be made provisional on a person sacri‘cing her bodily autonomy. By all accounts, therefore, the proposed law will fall foul of a pro portionality analysis. If nothing else, the Union government™s con cession in the Supreme Court de monstrates that there are several alternative, lessintrusive means available to regulate population.  Negative consequences But the new proposal is also wor rying because it is likely to bring with it a host of other deleterious consequences.  For instance, an already skewed sex ratio may be compounded by families aborting a daughter in the hope of having a son with a view to conforming to the twochild norm. The law could also lead to a proliferation in sterilisation camps, a practice that the Su preme Court has previously depre cated. In  Devika Biswas vsUnion of India (2016), the Court pointed to how these camps invariably have a disparate impact on minorities and other vulnerable groups.  As is so often the case with bad laws in India, though, this draft B illmay ‘nd support from some past judgments of the Supreme Court. In this case, the G overnment may point to the judgment in  Javed & Ors vs State of Haryana & Ors (2003), where the C ourt upheld a law that disquali‘ed persons with more than two children from con testing in local body elections. But not only is the present proposal far more disproportionate Š in that it virtually sanctions civil death for those that violate the norms it ‘xes Š the judgment in Javed can no longer be seen as good law. For one thing, its reasoning ’ies in the face of  Puttaswamy . But as rousing as the ninejudge B ench verdict is, its legacy depends on how its ‘ndings are applied. For the judgment to have tangible va lue and meaning, any law of this kind, which invades upon our most personal and ethical choices, must be seen as repugnant to the Constitution.Suhrith Parthasarathy is an advocate practising at the Madras High Court Making welfare conditional is a stamp of coercion Asimple reading of U.P.™s draft population control law is thatit will grossly impinge on the right to reproductiv e freedom Suhrith Parthasarathy  GETTY IMAGES/ISTOCKPHOTO Less than a month after the Centre revised its vacci nation policy and took over the responsibility of vaccine procurement from the S tates, old worries of a supply constraint appear to have resurfaced. Th eCentre™s  CoWIN database shows that the weekly pace of vaccination has declined to nearly 60% of what was seen in the week after June 21, causingseveral S tates, particularly in South India, to complainof a shortag e.On June 21, the ‘rst day of the new policy, 91 lakh doses were administered and until June 27, it was about 4 crore . The  period July 511 saw only 2.3 crore vaccine doses dispensed. The Centre™s move to take over vac cine administration  followed a chaotic April Maywhen the second wave roiled India with unprecedented fe rocity. This was also the time that saw a surge in vaccine demand and the country being unable to deliver be cause of an underestimation of the need and demand. The heady week of June21 27 saw 60 lakh vaccines a day becoming the norm. However, the last time India crossed that daily ‘gure was July 3. At least 86 lakh dos es have to be administered every day if all Indian adults are to be fully vaccinated by the year end. Beginning this week, the daily doses have again slipped to 30 40 lakh though this is better than in May when India strug gled to provide even 20 lakh doses a day. There are two major concerns with the slackening pace. One, India still has managed to inoculate only 33% of its adult population with at least one dose;  just about 8%have been fully vaccinated. At this rate, it  is impossible for the Centre to deliver on its stated goal of inoculating all Indian adults by the year end. Second ,the signs are apparent everywhere of an uptick in cases. The U.S. Š the only country with more cases than India Šafter a month of reporting less than 15,000 cases a day is now, like India, seeing over 40,000 cases a day .There has also been a rise there in daily deaths. A simi lar acceleration is also visible in the U.K. and both  these countries have vaccinated a large fraction of their adults. India, while better o† than in May, still averages about 8001,000 deaths a day . So,it  is far from being out of the woods even as  economic activity appears to have nearnormalised in many  parts . The Centre conti nues to put the onus on S tates for planning but does no taddress a  concern of inadequate Covaxin supplies. It has ordered at least eightcrore doses since January but only 4.7 crore have been administered. The concerns over a third wave have been voiced but meaningful pre paredness entails having enough vaccines. While dail yvaccination rates will see spikes and dips, aggressive publicity measures and campaigns are necessary to boost vaccination, as was seen  in end June. The Centre and S tates must work towards sprucing this up. Ramping up supply Spikes, dips in vaccination rates are normal, but India needs to guard against  slackening In what must be a déj à vu moment for outgoing Prime Minister K.P.Oli and President Bidya Devi Bhandari, the Supreme Court of Nepal set aside their dissolu tion, in May, of the House of Representatives. The apex court had in February overruled Mr. Oli™s decision to dissolve the House in December 2020 as well. But thi stime, the ruling was more than just a rap on his knuck les . The judgment also paved the way for Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress to be appointed as  Prime Minister after recognising his claim based on signatures of 149 lawmakers across di†erent parties a“rming their support . The ‘vemember Constitutional Bench also provided the way out of the unending political dea dlock in the House by allowing individual lawmakers to ignore their party whips during a trust vote that is a must win for Mr. Deuba. The inability of Mr. Oli and Mr. Deuba to win trust votes, prior to the dissolution deci sion by Ms. Bhandari, was because  the support for them  in the 275member House divided both the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (Uni‘ed MarxistLeninist) (UML) and the O pposition Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) as rebel lawmakers risked suspension. The  court™s  deci sion earlier in the year to derecognise the merged Ne pal Communist Party was another factor too. Mr. Oli had minority support within the merged NCP, but his faction retained the endorsement of the bulk of the le gislators in the demerged UML. The rebels, led by Mad hav Nepal and Jhala N ath Khanal, were limited to a smaller faction. The other component of the NCP, the Communist Party of Nepal (MaoistCentre), meanwhile endorsed Mr. Deuba™s candidacy, while the JSP was split vertically, with the Mahantha ThakurRajendra Mahato led faction supporting Mr. Oli as opposed to the Bab u ram BhattaraiUpendra Yadavled faction. It remains to be seen whether the lawmakers will now vote based on their individual agency with the fear of suspension gone. There is no guarantee that Mr. Deu ba will win a trust vote as he must secure the support of the rebel factions within the UML and the JSP. The Mad hav Nepalled faction, which has not endorsed Mr. Ol iand welcomed the judgment, has also been a mercurial force undecided on joining hands with the O pposition in this new situation. Nevertheless, this is a blow to Mr. Oli whose brinkmanship and authoritarian tendencies have come at a di“cult time for Nepalis reeling from the COVID19 outbreak. It is also a stinging rebuke to Ms. Bhandari whose actions as President rubber stamping her former party colleague Mr. Oli™s decisions have called into question her role as a constitutional func tionary. Mr. Deuba has his task cut out, but a ‘rm mes sage of unity and consultative governance can bring about political stability, something that has long eluded Nepal during both its constitutional monarchy and it srepublican periods.

The book is intended to serve as a guide to departmental o†cers and to others who are interested in the ques tion. The theory that the average Depressed class boy is inherently backward in receiving education is refuted as a mere “ction and the argument is advanced that given the ne cessary help, sympathy, opportunity and the special handling that is essential in view of the ages of enforced illiteracy through which he has passed, he can successfully compete with the rest in the end. ﬁWhat is necessary is to awaken him from his lethargy so far as education is concerned, wean him from the evil habits that are more often the e‘ects rather than causes of his degrada tion, and raise him from the mental depen dency to which has has sunk for want of op portunity and encouragement for generations, in short to give him a moral and mental tone in keeping with the physical that is in him and to get him to face life with faith in himself and his future.ﬂ AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 15, 1921 Education of Depressed classes. The allparty conference on Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) revealed the fai lure of the strategy crafted by the Go vernment of India. The Bharatiya Ja nata Party (BJP) has long urged the abrogation of Article 370 of the Con stitution. But the constitutional coup went miles beyond that. It abrogated Article 35A as well, broke up the State of J&K  by lopping o‘ Ladakh, and reduced the rest to a Union Ter ritory. It is unthinkable that any oth er State would have received the treatment meted out to J&K  whose ‚special status™ was an eyesore. But the elephant in the room was the law on delimitation of the consti tuencies. It trumpeted the real object of the coup loud and clear, which was to wipe out the political setup in J&K and establish a new political or der. To accomplish this, virtually the entire political class of Kashmir had to be put out of action, the press muzzled, assemblies banned, tou rists given marching orders, schools and colleges shut, and electronic communications suspended. Abrogation of Article 370 Article 370 cannot be abrogated even by Parliament, let alone by the Presi dent. Even the letter of Article 370 bars that. But there is a profound rea son which fundamentally bars such a result. To cite an example, insurgen cy erupted in Mizoram on February 28, 1966. The Mizo National Front (MNF) led by Laldenga began an armed insurgency and declared in dependence the next day. On June 30, 1986,  the Mizoram Accord was signed. It said: ﬁNotwithstanding anything contained in the Constitu tion, no Act of Parliament in respect of (a) Religion or social practices of the Mizos, (b) Mizo customary law or procedure, (c) Administration of civil and criminal justice involving deci sions according to Mizo customary law, (d) Ownership and transfer of land, shall apply to the State of Mizo ram unless the Legislative Assembly of Mizoram by a resolution so de cides.ﬂ On February 20, 1987, the 53rd Constitution Amendment came into force inserting Article 371G which reads thus: ﬁNotwithstanding anything in this Constitution, no Act of Parliament in respect of (i) Reli gious or social practices of the Mizos, (ii) Mizo customary law and proce dure, (iii) Administration of civil and criminal justice involving decisions according to Mizo customary law, (iv) Ownership and transfer of land, shall apply to the State of Mizoram unless the Legislative Assembly of Mizoram by a resolution so decides.ﬂ The two are identically worded because Article 371G gives legal force to an accord between the Union and the MNF. Parliament cannot repeal it or even amend it unilaterally.  Article 370 stands on a higher foot ing. It gives legal force to an accord between the Union and a State of the Union and the parleys were held by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his deputy, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. They began at Patel™s  residence on May 15, 1949 and ended in midOc tober with an agreed text. But it was moved in an altered form in the Con stituent Assembly on October 17, 1949 by N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar in the absence of Sheikh Abdullah who happened to be in the lobby. He rushed to the House. Article 370 made Kashmir™s Con stituent Assembly the sole authority to accord consent to any addition to the Centre™s power and to further ex tension  to Kashmir of India™s Consti tution. The Assembly “rst met on Oc tober 31, 1951 and was formally dissolved on November 17, 1956. Arti cle 370 enabled the State govern ment to accord its concurrence only subject to J&K™s Constituent Assem bly™s concurrence. This was abused to make the State government and even the Governor alone to be the consenting authority. The result? Ninetyfour of the 97 entries in the Central List were ap plied to Kashmir leaving a balance of three. So much for the ‚special sta tus™. The Constitution is studded with ‚special™ provisions for Naga land, Assam, Manipur, Andhra Pra desh, Sikkim, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, and Goa (Article 371A1). Kashmir had an elected SadrERiya sat. The Centre replaced him with a Governor it nominated. We have high legal authority for challenging the ‚laws™ of August 5, 2019. After the First World War, countries of the British Empire were restive about their independence. In 1926, the Earl of Balfour devised a formula which pleased all. The auto nomy of those countries was recog nised simultaneously with their loyalty to the British Crown. This was incorporated in the Statute of West minster passed in 1931 by the British Parliament. It said that no law it passed would extend to the Domi nions unless they had so wished (Section 4). In 1935, the Privy Council ruled that ﬁthe Imperial Parliament could, as a matter of abstract law, re peal or disregard Section 4 of the Sta tute. But that is theory and has no re lation to realities. In truth, Canada is in enjoyment of the full scope of self governmentﬂ  (British Coal Corpora tion v. The King). Areas of ‚special status™ Areas of ‚special status™ abound the world over.  Scotland joined England in 1707 to form Great Britain. It held a referendum on its independence without its beingcalled ‚treason™. Quebec held two referenda on seces sion in 1980 and 1995. All three failed.For historic reasons, the German majority South Tyrol is partly Italy. Its autonomy is guaranteed by an AustroItalian accord. The Swedish majority Aaland Islands are Finnish territory under an accord of 1921. The autonomy of both territories (Aaland Islands and South Tyrol) is internationally guaranteed. Indonesia quelled militancy in Aceh by an accord on August 15, 2005 based on ﬁspecial autonomyﬂ. Newfoundland signed the Terms of Union with Canada on December 11, 1948 after a referendum. Denmark conferred home rule on Greenland in 1979. On June 12, 2009, Denmark enacted an Act on Greenland SelfGo vernment to confer greater power than that of our States.  Fifty years ago, Sheikh Abdullah told former Foreign Secretary Y.D. Gundevia, ﬁOnly that person who en joys the con“dence of the Govern ment of India can be Chief Minister of Kashmirﬂ. A ‚special status™ worse than, say, Kerala or Tamil Nadu, which can have Chief Ministers that the Centre does not approve of. The Supreme Court™s record on Kashmir is uninspiring. The matter is too politicised. The petitions must be withdrawn in favour of a political, peaceful, constitutional approach. The Gupkar Declaration of August 4, 2019 must be ampli“ed in a Convention. On July 9, 1953 Maulana Azad of fered to Sheikh Abdullah that the Go vernment of India ﬁis willing to de clare that the special position given to Kashmir will be made permanent without any conditionsﬂ. Abdullah replied on July 16, ﬁIf such a declara tion had been earlier, it would have strengthened my handsﬂ. Now, ﬁif I fail to gain the con“dence of my peo ple here, I will not be able to render my service to my friends.ﬂ The peo ple matter more than they did in 1953. Statesmanship lies in crafting a solution acceptable to them. Time is running out. The Delimita tion Commission visited Kashmir  toful“l the vision of the BJP™s Vision Document Š more seats for Jammu.

Noorani is a constitutional expert The allparty conference failed because it completely ignored Kashmiri sentiments  People™s voice and Kashmir™s future  A.G. Noorani  PTIThe Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) is India™s premier national institute for improving access to education. Recently, IGNOU  launched a degree course in astrolo gy.  This obsession with astrology is not a new phenomenon in a country which recently sent a spacecraft in orbit around  Mars. A si milar decision was taken by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2001, which was withdrawn after widespread opposition. In this context, all the citizens of this country who are concerned about the status of education and the role of scienti“c tempe rament in education need to take a stance about this deci sion.  Content of syllabus Let us start by examining what is covered by the  IGNOU syllabus. Even a casual look at the syllabus gives us an understanding of  the unscienti“c nature of the course. The syllabus includes the study of horoscopes, which are determined by  thestate of di‘erent planets at the time of our birth and which apparently impact all the things that we do throughout our life. It also includes how to decide on an auspicious time for initiating a speci“c task. It  claims to train its students in how to nullify the ill ef fects occurring due to speci“c problems in their horoscope. The range of problems for which astrology can o‘er solutions has no  limit. It provides solutions on when  one needs to apply for a job to ensure a good result to even determining the time a nation has to take a decision to start a war!  Let us try and evaluate the three basic as sumptions of astrology on which this sylla bus is based. The “rst assumption is that the planets around us in the universe have a con tinuous e‘ect on human life. The second as sumption is that the result depends on the time of birth of the person and the third as sumption is that the future of a person de pends on all this and can be changed by solu tions o‘ered by an astrologer. Let us now look at the main objections by astronomy (the science of the universe) to these assumptions. As per astrology, nine Navagrahas a‘ect our lives. All of us know that four of these  Navagrahas are not even grahas (planets). The sun is not a planet but astar. The moon is the natural satellite of the earth. Rahu and Ketu, which are claimed to be the most dangerous planets in astrology, are not even planets but points of intersec tion of the paths of the sun and the moon .The Milky Way, in which the sun and solar system are included, has countless  stars oth er than the sun. It is not very di†cult to ap preciate how unscienti“c and potentially dangerous it will be to allow something like astrology as a mainstream course. Next, let us look at  the time of birth. The nature of a horoscope is dependent on the time of one™s birth. And the time of birth used for this purpose by astrology is the time when the baby takes the “rst breath outside the mother™s womb. Modern science tells us that the baby is actually born when the sperm and ovum come together to form the embryo, and it grows for the next nine months through di‘erent stages. How do all these  Navagrahas  not have any impact on the baby when it is inside the mother™s womb and start a‘ecting it only when it comes out? Astrologers have no answer. It is a simple ob servation that thousands of chil dren are born in the world every second and their futures are not the same. What will be in their ho roscope when a human being gives birth to a baby, say, on the moon or Mars tomorrow? The most serious e‘ect of depending on as trology is that it takes  human agency out of our lives .Science and pseudoscience While we are on the path to astrology, Elon Musk, an American businessman, has start ed a project to humanise Mars under the SpaceX mission. The robotic rovers sent by NASA to Mars are collecting information and sending it back to earth.  Stephen Hawking stated that the search for a habitable planet like earth in the universe should be the prior ity of astronomical research. Against this background, one needs to learn to di‘eren tiate between astrology, which is a pseudo science, and astrophysics, which is a robust scienti“c discipline. Astrology exploits the vulnerability of the human mind while peo ple face  uncertainty. On the other hand, as trophysics depends on the core scienti“c principles of precise observations, hypothe sis, experimentation and results based on all these. In an era where pseudoscience has started becoming the new normal, it™s our responsibility as citizens to oppose such de cisions and demand the withdrawal of such a course. Hamid Dabholkar is a psychiatrist and member of the rationalist movement, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti No pseudoscience, please Astrology exploits the vulnerability of the human mind and should not be taught as a mainstream course by universities Hamid Dabholkar                                                                              CC                                                                              CCDATA POINT The Delhi Chief Minister  recently wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to consider award ing an ﬁIndian Doctorﬂ the  Bharat Ratna, the country™s highest civilian honour. ﬁBy an ‚Indian doctor™, I mean the entire medical community Šall doctors, nurses and paramedics should be given the award, collective ly,ﬂ he wrote.  He requested the Prime Minister to change the rules if the current rules do not permit confer ment on any group as such. While this is a great gesture, changing the rules would open a Pan dora™s box  and erase the sanctity at tached to this prestigious award. There is no doubt that doctors need to be honouredfor their relentless and dedicated service during the pandemic. But there were many  who also ’eeced  patients and the kin of the deceased by  exploiting their helplessness and desperation . Many private hospitals charged exorbitant amounts for treatment. Should these plunderers also be grouped with those who worked sel’essly and be part of the honour?  Paying compensation Rather than eulogising their  services, the Chief Minister could have at least ensured that the doctors and nurses were paid their salaries on time. Sev eral doctors and nurses went on strike because they were not paid. According to the Indian Medical As sociation, 798 doctors died in the se cond wave. With Delhi recording the highest number of such fatalities (128 doctors), the Chief Minister should have paid an ex gratia amount of š1 crore to each of them . The Delhi go vernment had, in April 2020, an nounced š1 crore in ex gratia for fami lies of frontline workers who die of the infection while on duty. But most of the families of the doctors have not been paid. Nor have the kin of police men who died of the infection while on duty.  The wife of a deceased con stable knocked on the doors of Delhi High Court claiming the promised amount. The hearing is scheduled for July 28. While doctors and paramedics rendered yeoman service during the pandemic, other frontline workers, including the police, too contributed at grave risk to their lives.  Meanwhile, while the local courts in New Delhi have reprimanded the Delhi Police for their handling of the riots and “ned them š25,000 for mis handling of cases related to the riots, 25 personnel of the Delhi Police have staked their claim for the President™s Police Medal for Gallantry, citing their role in the Delhi riots last year. Among them is the then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ved Prakash Surya, who was seen standing next to BJP leader Kapil Mishra when Mr. Mishra was delivering a controversial speech a day before the riots broke out. Even the Joint Commissioner of Police has entered the fray. Choosing the awardees Every individual will  exaggerate his role in the riots to stake his claim. Much would depend on the projec tion of the individual™s role in a man ner that would be convincing enough to consider the case for award of a medal. In such rigmarole, the possi bility of the wrong persons getting awarded cannot be ruled out. The deserving ones who are left out get demoralised and shy away from ex posing themselves to risk. According to a senior o†cial of Delhi Police, a highpowered com mittee of senior o†cials goes through every case thoroughly. Depending on the degree of bravery displayed by each, a few are recommended for the gallantry medals while others are re commended for the Police Commis sioner™s Commendation Disc. There is always a proclivity for of “cers to garner gallantry medals as these carry monthly allowances and other perks such as free travel by train with a companion and even a rentfree landline telephone. O†cers cannot operate in isolation and they are accompanied by their subordi nates. Utmost care needs to be taken to ensure that the deserving among the lower ranks are not left out when they have displayed bravery in deal ing with unruly elements at grave risk to their own lives. M.P. Nathanael is Inspector General of Police (Retd), CRPF Awards cannot be doled out Care needs to be taken to ensure that only those deserving of awards receive them M.P. Nathanael When the Chinese communists “rst came to power, they argued that China as a socialist State had no need to worry about the popu lation problem. But a more sober attitude has prevailed since the collapse of the ﬁgreat leap forwardﬂ in 1958 and today the two child family is advocated, with the right age for marriage “xed at 25 for women and 28 for men. It this ideal is realised, a stable pop ulation would result. Chinawatchers based in Hongkong have estimated China™s popula tion at 830 millions in 1970 and the crude birth and death “gures at 43 and 21 per thou sand, yielding a growth rate of 2.2 per cent. Even this would mean that China would reach the billion mark by 1980 and 1.6 billion by the end of the century. Mr. Edgar Snow, the American writer and friend of Mao Tse tung, has reported after another visit to Chi na recently that the present population is so mewhere between 750 and 800 millions and that the rate of growth is about 2 per cent. The Chinese planners hope to cut the rate to one per cent, though even this would yield a billionstrong population by 2000 A.D.

Afghanistan™s Interior Mi nistry denied the insurgents had taken the area even as social media was †ooded with pictures of Taliban “ghters relaxing in the fron tier town. Residents also told AFP it was in the Taliban's hands. Spin Boldak is the latest in astring of border crossings and dry ports seized by the Taliban in recent weeks, with the insurgents looking to choke o‘ muchneeded revenue from the govern ment in Kabul while also “ll ing their own co‘ers. Heavy †ghting  The seizure of the border crossing follows days of hea vy “ghting across Kandahar province, where the govern ment was forced to deploy commando “ghters to pre vent the fall of the provincial capital even as the insur gents inched closer to taking the frontier. In a statement, insurgent spokesman Zabihullah Muja hid assured traders and resi dents there that their ﬁsecur ity is guaranteedﬂ. But Afghan o’cials insist ed they were still in control. ﬁThe terrorist Taliban had some movements near the border area... The security forces have repelled the at tack,ﬂ Interior Ministry spo kesman Tareq Arian said. Strategic value  Residents disputed the go vernment™s claims, however.  The border crossing is one of the most strategically va luable for the Taliban.  It provides direct access to Pakistan™s Balochistan pro vince Š where the insur gents™ top leadership has been based for decades Š along with an unknown number of reserve “ghters who regularly enter Afghan istan to help bolster their ranks.Hours after the crossing fell, an AFP reporter on the Pakistani side saw around 150 Taliban “ghters riding on motorcycles, waving insur gent †ags, as they demanded to be allowed to cross into Af ghanistan. Balochistan is a favoured destination for “ghters regularly heading for medical treatment and hosts many of their families. Amajor highway leading from the border connects to Pakistan™s commercial capi tal Karachi and its sprawling port on the Arabian Sea, which is considered a linch pin for Afghanistan's billion dollar heroin trade that has provided a crucial source of revenue for the Taliban's war chest over the years.

The Taliban are making huge advances across the country as they capitalise on the “nal withdrawal of fo reign troops Š capturing dis tricts, seizing key border crossings, and encircling provincial capitals. Harsh rule  In some areas they are again introducing the harsh inter pretation of Islamic rule that earned them notoriety until being overthrown by the US led invasion that followed the September 11 attacks. Last month they took Sher Khan Bandar, a northern customs post that connected the country to Tajikistan ov er a U.S.funded bridge that spanned the Panj river.  ﬁAfter Sher Khan Bandar fell, the Taliban ordered wo men not to step out of their homes,ﬂ said Sajeda, who told AFP she worked in a lo cal factory at the time. ﬁThere were many women and young girls doing em broidery, tailoring and shoe making... The Taliban's or der has now terri“ed us.ﬂ  The Taliban ruled Afghan istan from 1996 to 2001 ac cording to an interpretation of the Koran little changed in centuries. Banned from school Women were ordered to stay indoors unless accompanied by a male relative, girls were banned from school, and those found guilty of crimes such as adultery were stoned to death. Men had relatively more freedom but were ordered not to shave, would be bea ten if they didn™t attend prayers, and were told to on ly wear traditional clothing. Afghanistan is deeply con servative and some rural pockets of the country adh ere to similar rules even without Taliban oversight  but the insurgents have tried to impose these edicts even in more modern centres.
