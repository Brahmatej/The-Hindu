THE HINDU VISAKHAPATNAM
SUNDAY,JULY18,2021 13FAQThe story so far: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday banned Mastercard from issuing new debit and credit cards to customers in India with e†ect from July 22. According to the RBI, the U.S. cardissuer has failed to comply with the local data storage rules announced by the central bank in 2018. The ban has unsettled banks operating in India that use Mastercard™s services to issue a variety of cards to their customers.  What is the RBI™s data localisation policy?  In 2018, the Indian central bank had issued a circular ordering card companies such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express to store all Indian customer data locally so that the regulator could have ﬁunfettered supervisory accessﬂ. This meant that foreign card companies had to store complete information about transactions made by Indian customers in servers located within India. Companies were initially required to comply with these rules within six months. The reason o†ered by the RBI to back up its data localisation rule was that local storage of consumer data is necessary to protect the privacy of Indian users and also to address national security concerns. Since the order, Mastercard, Visa and other foreign card companies have lobbied to dilute the rules. But the RBI has remained strict that companies must comply with its data localisation rules. Consequently, Mastercard deleted Indian customer data from its foreign servers and promised to invest in building local servers in India to store local customer data. The RBI, however, has not been impressed. It has banned Mastercard from issuing new cards to customers from July 22. Reuters reported Mastercard as having said it was ﬁdisappointedﬂ with the RBI™s decision and it had provided regular updates on its compliance with the rules since 2018. The company was quoted as saying it would continue to work with the Indian central bank to provide any additional details required to resolve its concerns.  Existing Mastercard customers, however, can continue to use their cards. Earlier this year, American Express and Diners Club International were also banned by the RBI from issuing new cards after they failed to comply with the 2018 circular.  What is the need for local data storage? Experts believe that customer privacy and national security are genuine concerns that need to be taken seriously. However, many also believe that data localisation rules are too stringent and they could simply be used by governments as tools of economic protectionism. For instance, they argue, it may not be strictly necessary for data to be stored locally to remain protected. Broadly speaking, formal international laws to govern the storage of digital information across borders may be su“cient to deal with these concerns. Governments, however, may still mandate data localisation in order to favour local companies to foreign ones.  China, for example, has used its cybersecurity laws to discriminate against foreign companies. A similar trend may be playing out in India with the Centre™s emphasis on economic selfsu“ciency. In 2018, Mastercard had launched a complaint with the U.S. government that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was actively promoting Indian cards like RuPay and that it was a†ecting the business of foreign card companies. Governments may also believe that mandating foreign companies to set up local infrastructure can boost their local economies.  What lies ahead? Indian banks that are currently enrolled in the Mastercard network are expected to make alternative arrangements with other card companies. The process is expected to take a few months, and their card business is expected to take a signi‘cant hit meanwhile. The RBI™s data localisation policy, as it burdens foreign card companies, may end up favouring domestic card issuers like RuPay. Mastercard owns about onethird of the market share in India, and the RBI™s ban is likely to signi‘cantly bene‘t its competitors. RBL Bank, for instance, has decided to enter into an agreement with Visa after the RBI™s ban on Mastercard. Similarly, the ban on American Express and Diners Club earlier this year bene‘ted the Indian card network RuPay. Some believe that even Visa, a foreign company which dominates card payments in India, may come under regulatory pressure in the near future. Thus, the card payments sector may end up being restricted to a few domestic companies, which in turn can lead to reduced competition. This could mean higher costs and lower quality services for customers.  It is also worth noting that in today™s digital economy data have turned out to be a valuable commodity, which companies as well as governments have tried to gain control over. Information about spending patterns and other customer data can be monetised by companies in a variety of ways. With no clear rules on who owns customer data and to what extent, con’icts over data ownership are likely to continue for some time.  Curbs on Mastercard  What are the rules on data storage and why has the RBI barred the  U.S. company from taking on  new customers in India?  Existing Mastercard customers will be allowed to use their cards.

In trouble:The ban has unsettled banks that use Mastercard™s services to issue a variety of cards. REUTERSThe story so far: On Wednesday, social media platform Twitter released its Transparency Report for the second half of last year (July 1 to December 31), in which it was revealed that India was the single largest source of government information requests. India also was one of the prominent sources of legal demands for removal of content, according to the report.  What™s the transparency report all about?  Twitter started publishing a biannual report Š Twitter Transparency Report Š in 2012. The original goal, it says in its blog, ﬁwas to provide the public with recurring insights into government pressures that impacted the public, whether through overt political censorship or by way of compelling account data through information requestsﬂ.  It further says, ﬁA lot has changed since 2012. It is now more important than ever that we also shine a light on our own practices, including enforcement of the Twitter Rules and our ongoing work to disrupt global statebacked information operations.ﬂ  Over the years, the scope of the report has been expanded gradually. Additional categories such as nongovernment legal requests, trademark notices, coordinated manipulation, and so on, have been added from time to time. This aspect of reporting isn™t rare any more.  Google, which has been issuing its transparency reports since 2010, says in its blog that ﬁtransparency reporting is an increasingly common practice across industriesﬂ. It then goes on to list over 40 brands, from Facebook to Reddit, and from Uber to Yahoo!, that undertake transparency reporting.  What are the highlights of the latest report?  As mentioned above, there are di†erent categories under which Twitter provides the data. One of the main categories is ‚Government Information Requests,™ and this includes ﬁboth emergency and routine legal demands for account information issued by law enforcement and other government agenciesﬂ. The report noted that there was a 15% increase in such requests (and more than a 100% increase in the number of accounts speci‘ed in these requests) compared with the JanuaryJune 2020 period.  Notably, for the ‘rst time in the history of the transparency report, the U.S. wasn™t the ﬁtop global requesterﬂ. India was. It accounted for 25% of the global volume and 15% of the global accounts speci‘ed. The U.S., however, submitted the highest volume of global emergency requests, at 34%, followed by Japan (17%) and South Korea (16%). Twitter describes routine requests as ﬁlegal demands issued by government of law enforcement authorities (e.g. subpoenas, court orders, search warrants)ﬂ that compel it to turn over account information. Emergency requests, on the other hand, may be entertained ﬁif we are provided with su“cient information to support a good faith belief that there is an imminent threat involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, and we have information relevant to averting or mitigating the threatﬂ.  Under the category of ‚Government Information Requests,™ Twitter says it ﬁnarrowed or did not disclose information in response to 70%ﬂ of the requests. One of the other signi‘cant subcategories is ‚Legal Demands™, which provides data about court orders and other formal demands to remove content. The source of such demands can be ﬁgovernmental entities and lawyers representing individualsﬂ. While the number of global legal demands fell 9% to 38,524, a whopping 94% of the demands came from just ‘ve countries (Japan, India, Russia, Turkey and South Korea).  Japan was the top requester in this category, accounting for 43% of the total. India was next, at 18%. Japan™s requests, Twitter says, were largely related to ﬁlaws regarding narcotics and psychotropics, obscenity, or money lendingﬂ.  Alarge portion of Russian requests related to its laws prohibiting the promotion of suicide. This section of the report also notes that ﬁ199 accounts of veri‘ed journalists and news outlets from around the world were subject to 361 legal demands, a 26% increase in the number of accounts since the previous reporting period. These included removal requests from India (128), Turkey (108), Pakistan (52), and Russia (28)ﬂ.  The compliance rate, which is the ﬁpercentage of information requests where Twitter produced at least some sort of requested account informationﬂ, in the case of requests emerging from India was far less compared with the average of the worldwide data.  What else is notable about the new report?  Twitter has started reporting about two additional things. One is an impressions metric, which ﬁcaptures the number of views violative Tweets received prior to removalﬂ. The other is about the adoption of twofactor authentication ﬁto keep accounts safe and secureﬂ. About the ‘rst, Twitter said violative tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all tweets globally during this period, and it had removed 3.8 million tweets that ’outed its rules. Only 6% of the removed tweets had more than 1,000 impressions.  Was there another report speci†c to India?  On July 11, it published ‚Twitter™s India Transparency Report,™ under the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. It will be a monthly report from now on. This comes after months of uneasiness between the government and Twitter over the latter™s noncompliance with the new rules, including the delay in the appointment of a grievance o“cer. The social media platform has just complied with that requirement. This report dealt with user grievances and proactive monitoring, which Twitter says refers to ﬁcontent proactively identi‘ed by employing internal proprietary tools and industry hash sharing initiativesﬂ. In the MayJune period, it reportedly suspended over 18,000 accounts for child sexual exploitation and a further over 4,000 accounts for promotion of terrorism. Is Twitter acceding to takedown requests?  How has the social media platform reacted to pleas for information data from governments around the world?  Sriram Srinivasan  True picture: India is one of the prominent sources of legaldemands for removal of content, says the report.  APOn July 11, it published ‚Twitter™s India Transparency Report,™ under the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. It will be a monthly report unlike the biannual Transparency Report The story so far:  The second wave of COVID19, which began rising in Kerala in the second week of April, peaked midMay, when the State was reporting around 44,000 cases daily and had about 4.45 lakh active cases in the community. The test positivity rate (TPR) hovered around 30%. The State then went into a total lockdown for over a fortnight, after which the case graph came down. But since the past one month or more, the epidemic curve has remained on a plateau, logging around 10,000 cases12,000 cases every day, and the TPR is at 10%11%. At a time when COVID19 cases across the nation have come down sharply, Kerala accounts for about 30% of the country™s active caseload. In the past two weeks, the case graph has been rising again, recording a 20% growth. On July 17, Kerala reported 16,148 fresh COVID19 cases. Maharashtra, which has also seen cases rising, registered 8,172 fresh cases on the same day. Why is the epidemic curve not coming down? Public health experts point out that what is happening in Kerala now is no di†erent than what was witnessed in the State after the ‘rst wave. The ‘rst wave peaked in Kerala by the end of last October, the curve plateaued and remained unchanged for a long time. In JanuaryFebruary, recording between 1,500 and 3,000 fresh cases daily, Kerala accounted for over 45% of the active cases in the country. The epidemic curve never hit the baseline after the ‘rst wave in Kerala because of two things Š the largescale mixing of people and huge gatherings and rallies during the campaigning in February ahead of the election in April, which was followed by the arrival of the highly transmissible Delta variant. The ‘rst wave was yet to taper down, when Kerala rode into the second wave with a daily caseload of over 2,500 in the second week of April. The case graph then rose exponentially to reach a daily tally of almost 45,000 cases by midMay. Other States had already experienced the worst of the second wave when the curve began rising in Kerala. Because the second wave was delayed, the epidemic curve in the State is expected to remain on aplateau for a prolonged period and at a higher daily average of fresh cases (because of the Delta variant). What is the rate of community transmission? The third round of the national seroprevalence survey, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in three districts of Kerala in January, revealed that only 11.6% of the population had been exposed to the virus, against a national average of 21%. This meant that when the second wave struck, 89% of the State™s 3.5crore population was immunologically naive and at risk of contracting COVID19. When a highly transmissible virus variant like Delta is in circulation among a susceptible population, the level of e“ciency with which the community was maintaining nonpharmacological means of protection against the virus (masking and physical distancing) will no longer be enough to check transmission. Cases will continue to occur till a chunk of the population is a†ected or the transmission is reduced substantially through vaccination. Testing has been consistent in Kerala, with an average of 1.3 lakh samples tested daily. The o“cial stance is that Kerala is picking up one out of every three infections in the community, while the national rate is one in 25 infections.  What has been  Kerala™s strategy? Kerala™s strategy in COVID19 containment has always been to keep a tight check on transmission through targeted testing, contacttracing and isolation of infected individuals. The attempt was always to delay the peak of the curve and spread out the infection so that the cases never exceeded the health system capacity. At the peak of the second wave too, though the health infrastructure was severely stressed, the State managed to tide over the situation fairly well. There were tense situations but people were never denied care nor were there distressing scenes of people running around for oxygen beds or ventilators. Unlike the sharp rise and fall of the epidemic curve in most States, Kerala™s epidemic curve had a gradual rise and decline. This means that while the duration of the epidemic would be longer, the impact on the community would be less.  What is the current situation? Aprolonged plateauing of the epidemic curve and a slight increase in transmission after the lockdown was expected. However, a 20% growth in cases after the plateau over the last two weeks is beginning to look worrying. Cases are going up mainly in the northern districts. The active caseload, which came down below the 1lakh mark, has climbed to 1.24 lakh again, and while ICU occupancy is down, new hospital admissions are showing a rising trend. Did something go wrong postlockdown? The State™s current strategy of allowing relaxations, solely on the basis of TPR, has turned out to be unscienti‘c, counterproductive and has been criticised by the scienti‘c community as well as the people. The reliability of TPR as an epidemiological indicator of disease transmission is dependent on who is being tested. Testing among primary contacts of the known COVID19 cases and highrisk individuals will show more infections in the community but this will mean an increased TPR and another round of lockdown. Now that the government has linked TPR to lockdown relaxations, the reduction of TPR has become the goal for local bodies. Rather than targeted testing, the focus is now on reducing TPR by organising mass testing camps where asymptomatic people are o†ered incentives to test themselves. Increasing the denominator by testing a large population and testing within a relatively lowrisk population can arti‘cially bring about a reduction in TPR. The State has to break the transmission now by ‘nding active pockets of disease in the community through diligent targeted testing and tracing of primary contacts and highrisk individuals. ﬁWhat is needed is microcontainment, rather than closing down an entire panchayat based on TPR. Skewed policies such as restricting the opening of shops to certain days of the week is actually leading to overcrowding and superspread events,ﬂ a Health o“cial admitted. What happens next? Going forward, increasing the pace of vaccination and keeping a sharp eye on the circulation of SARSCoV2 variants through continuous genomic surveillance assumes importance.  Compared with the rest of India, Kerala has managed vaccination very well, administering the ‘rst dose to 45% of its population above 18 years and the second dose to 17% as on July 17. Though the State has the capacity to administer 2.5 lakh3 lakh doses a day, erratic vaccine supply has made this impossible. The State is ahead as far as genomic surveillance goes, with institutions doing targeted sequencing, apart from the whole genomic sequencing done at national institutes. Over 80% of the samples analysed in the State in recent months have been the Delta variant, though more cases of Delta Plus have also been surfacing. Kerala is also planning to do a seroprevalence survey soon, including among children. The seropositivity is expected to be much higher than what it was during the ICMR survey in January, given that over 31 lakh people have already had COVID19, and have natural immunity, apart from the proportion of the population who have vaccinederived immunity. Why is there a COVID spike in Kerala?  Has the State lifted the  lockdowns too quickly? What  should be the strategy to  contain transmission now? C.
