Thecritical issues confronting  Indianauthorities only illustrate that Indian diplomacy is lacking the punch to rein in such multinationals despite being a major investment hub. International courts are independent in the sense that they may not be expected to be considerate to our line of action.  Insuch a situation, it is necessary that the Indian government is prudent enough to be more proactive in pre-empting such anomalous situations as it may dent the country™s image as far as  overseas investors are concerned. Social media platforms are bold enough to defy the diktats of even the U.S. President. We are living in a globalised era and a  policy of give and take through continued discussions should be the way forward .V. Subramanian, ChennaiDilip Kumar As a teenager, and while walking out of Prabhat Cinema Hall in Mysore after watching Bimal Roy™s classic,  Devadas ,a Dilip Kumar starrer, I wore a genuinely sad look. A couple of friends of mine I ran into asked me what my problem was that made me wear such a long face. After their persistent queries,  Itold them that I was feeling cut up because our †lm industry had lost a super star in the tragic demise of a†lm star, who was into his performances. His memory will remain etched in our minds.  Rafique Ahmed Nari, Chennaiirreplaceable .

To read more letters online, scan the QR code Arti Raghavan On June 25,2021, a mend- ments to the Bar Council of India rules (https:// bit.ly/2SZLcah) which govern the professional conduct and eti- quette of advocates were noti†ed .They render advocates liable for disciplinary proceedings for mak- ing disparaging statements about a court, judge, the Bar Council of In- dia (or S tate Bar Councils) or its members. The consequences in- clude suspension and disbarment. The amendments clarify that ﬁ– healthy and bona-†de criticism made in good faith, shall not be treated as a ‚misconduct™ﬂ.  Challenges were mounted be- fore various High Courts imme- diately after the amendments were noti†ed. The Bar Council of India,  in response, has kept the rules in abeyance, pending a re- view by a committee comprising senior advocates, members of bar associations and the Bar Council of India. The amendments also re- quire the Chief Justice of India™s approval before coming into ef- fect, which has not yet been obtained. The intent is clear The intent behind these amend- ments is betrayed by events that preceded their introduction: On May 25, 2020, 22 senior advocates addressed an open letter (https:// bit.ly/36oLeLV) urging the Su- preme Court of India to intervene in the migrant crisis. A retired judge of the Supreme Court also wrote an article (https:// bit.ly/3qXRx2s) on May 28, con- demning the Court™s inaction in this regard. In response, the Bar Council of Indiaissued a press re- lease (https://bit.ly/2VetQqL) on May 30, characteris ing the criti- cism as a ﬁsustained and synchro- nized attack on Supreme Court (sic)ﬂ by ﬁdisgruntled members of the bar and some unhappy and disappointed former judgesﬂ.  This was followed by an attack on a legal news portal (Live Law) for an article (https:// bit.ly/2VkCrbv) that was critical of the Bar Council of India Chairman,Manan Kumar Mishra. The article noted how the Chairman accused certain advocates of politicis ing the Bar, while himself openly pro- fessing his allegiance to the Bhara- tiya Janata Party (BJP). In 2014, as Chairman of the Bar Council of In- dia, he pledged his support for the party and Narendra Modi, holding himself out as the representative of India™s nearly 1.7 million advo- cates.  In 2016, he addressed a fawning missive to  Prime Minister Modi (on the Bar Council of India letter- head), describing him  as the ﬁmost e“cient and able leader of the worldﬂ. The article recounted how the Chairman championed a ‚Men Too Movement™ (https:// bit.ly/36tVORC) following the sex- ual harassment complaint against former Chief Justice of India Ran- jan Gogoi, and also denounced an- ti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act proteste rs as ﬁilliterate, ignorant massﬂ. In each of these actions, Mr. Mishra claimed to speak on be- half of the Indian Bar, and the arti- cle deprecated this improper use of public o“ce.  There was swift retaliation to the Live Law article. A Bar Council of India resolution (https:// bit.ly/2UBdUyq), condemned the author for ﬁscandal mongering and vili†cationﬂ, and resolved to take action against the author and Live Law. The resolution extolled (without speci†cs) the ﬁ–laudable acts done and being done by the [Bar Council of India Chairman] for promotion of a strong, vibrant and independent Bar and Judiciaryﬂ. Achance for a review It was in this backdrop that on June 3, 2020, while India was in the throes of an unprecedented novel coronavirus pandemic, and access to justice was severely im- paired owing to the limited func- tioning of courts, the Bar Council of India convened a meeting and proposed amendments to the rules for professional conduct.  Contemporaneously, the Su- preme Court made its views on censure of the judiciary clear: at a time where only matters of excep- tional urgency were being enter- tained during the pandemic, the Court carved out an inordinate amount of time to charge indivi- duals (including advocate Prash- ant Bhushan) with criminal con- tempt for critical remarks about the Supreme Court. Today, the Court under the Chief Justice of In- dia, N.V. Ramana, along with the Committee reviewing the new rules, have an opportunity pre- vent a further assault on free speech by rejecting the amend- ments.  Historically, our country™s speech laws have served to fortify persons and institutions of power, while silencing those assailing their actions. Laws (such as sedi- tion and criminal contempt) per- petuate the †ction that the author- ity of these institutions rests on the fragile foundation of ‚public faith™, and that dissent would im- pair the ability of powerful institu- tions such as courts and govern- ment bodies to carry out their duties. This notion is a bogeyman that has been used to silence crit- ics, and is a colonial and feudal rel- ic. State institutions derive their authority from the power vested in them by the law, and nothing else. Criticism (no matter how trenchant) is essential to hold these institutions accountable, and strengthen them. Achilling e†ect The new Bar Council of India rules ‘y in the face of basic constitution- al guarantees of free speech and the freedom of profession. The events preceding the introduction of the amendments demonstrate how limited the scope for ﬁhealthyﬂ criticism under the new rules would be. Further, even if disciplinary proceedings under the new rules (should they come into e’ect) do not result in serious consequences such as disbar- ment, the pain of the process and the possible consequences to the careers of advocateswould have a chilling e’ect. The Bar Council of India™s  state- ment (suspending the amend- ments pending review by the com- mittee) notes that ﬁno prudent and real Advocate would oppose [the new rules]ﬂ and that ﬁSome people are in the habit to object to each and every reformative step, but [the Bar Council of India] is not going to succumb to any such undue pressureﬂ. Hopefully, the Bar Council of India™s statement is not a chronicle of a charade fore- told, and the amendments will be reviewed objectively.  ‚Professional conduct and eti- quette™ is an enigmatic phrase for the Indian Bar, as it is hard to fath- om what the aspirational standard is. Recently, the Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta, was questioned in court about the G overnment™s de- faults on its oxygen supply com- mitments during the second wave of the pandemic. In response, he said that ‚we have to act as respon- sible individuals™ and not as ‚un- happy girlfriends™, and added, ‚Let™s try and not be a cry baby™. Mr. Mehta™s response was not only unprofessional but was also un- suitable for the issue of citizens be- ing starved of oxygen. But his words are perhaps a †tting res- ponse to the Bar Council of India and other institutions that are ran- kled by criticism from citizens who have every right to raise their voices against authority in a democracy.

No country in history has ever grown faster and more dynamically. Not only have hundreds of millions been lifted out of poverty, but so- cial indicators have improved dra- matically. India™s developmental record has been much more mixed. Since the 1990s, the Indian economy has grown impressively, but it remains far behind China in its global competitiveness. Poverty has come down, but employment prospects for the majority remain limited to low-wage informal sec- tor jobs that are, by de†nition, pre- carious. Maybe, most startling of all, improvements in basic social development indicators have lagged, so much so that as Jean Drè ze and Amartya Sen have pointed out, India has actually fal- len behind Bangladesh and Pakis- tan.  The ‚too democratic™ line Comparing these track records, some commentators, including voices in the Government, have drawn a facile lesson. India™s pro- blem is that it is just too democrat- ic. Unlike China, making and im- plementing key decisions about public investment and various re- forms is impossible in the din of multiple and contradictory demo- cratic voices. What is needed are †rmer and more independent forms of decision-making that are insulated from this cacophony.  This line of thinking has at va- rious times been embraced by sec- tions of the Left (Leninism) and multi-lateral technocrats and bankers, but, increasingly, has be- come the animating fantasy of right-wing leaders and move- ments, ranging from elected auto- crats such as  Donald Trump, Bra- zil™s Jair Bolsonaro and Narendra Modi. The strangeness of these bedfellows alone should be cause for alarm. But in the current mo- ment, it is especially important to be clear why comparisons with China are not only specious, but very dangerous. The claim that less democracy is good for development does not stand up to comparative, theoreti- cal and ethical scrutiny. Contrary to those who believe economic management cannot be left to the whims of democratic forces, the comparative evidence clearly shows that democratic regimes have on balance performed better than non-democratic regimes.  China, with a history of state- building going back two millennia, and an exceptionally well-organ- ised, disciplined and brutal form of authoritarianism, has done es- pecially well in transforming its economy. Africa and West Asia ,where authoritarian governments of every stripe have dominated, remain world economic laggards. The Latin American military dicta- torships of the 1960s and 1970s had a terrible economic and social record, and it was with the return of democracy and the ﬁpink waveﬂ of Left populist parties that  pros- perity and social progress were ushered in. Taiwan and South Ko- rea are also instructive. Their eco- nomic take-o’s happened under military regimes and relied on la- bour repression. Their transitions to democracy saw their econo- mies move up to the next level and become much more inclusive.  Democracy and development Most pointedly though, one only has to look within India to under- stand how development and de- mocracy can thrive together. By just about any measure, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have done more to improve the lives of all their citi- zens across castes and classes than any other S tates in India and it is no coincidence that both have also had the longest and most sus- tained popular democratic move- ments and intense party competi- tion in the country. In contrast, in Gujarat, where single party Bhara- tiya Janata Party rule has been in place for nearly a quarter century, growth has been solid but accom- panied by increased social exclu- sion and stagnation in educational achievement and poverty reduc- tion. The comparative record leaves little doubt that on balance, democracies are better at promot- ing inclusive growth. The theory behind the authori- tarian fantasy also does not hold up. First, the assumption that authoritarianism supports forms of decision-making that can rise above the hubbub of democratic demand-making to get things done presumes that those in command will serve the general interest rath- er than catering to the powerful and that when they enjoy such au- tonomy, they actually know what to do with it. This is just hubris. On both these points, democracies are in fact more likely to meet the necessary conditions for success- ful decision making. Elected re- presentatives, no matter how ve- nal, have to win re-election, which means answering to a broad swath of the electorate.  It allows negotiation The con‘icts and noise that de- mocracy generates may compli- cate things, but in the end, having to respond to a broad spectrum of interests and identities not only protects against catastrophic deci- sions, but actually allows for forms of negotiation and compromise that can bridge across interests and even balance otherwise con- ‘icting imperatives for growth, justice, sustainability and social in- clusion. The remarkable progress the United Progressive Alliance go- vernments made in building a wel- fare state (National Rural Employ- ment Guarantee Act, the Right To Information, the right to food and other programmes) is a testament to how a democracy can master even the most complex policy goals. As democratic theorists have long argued, the common good cannot and should not  be de- termined by science, pro†ts, tech- nocrats or autocratic †at. What it is and how we get there can only emerge out of sustained societal deliberation. Alook at China India™s tryst with democracy was born not only of its liberation movement but also of its a“nity with what makes democracy ethi- cally unique: it promotes equality by endowing all citizens with the same civic, political and social rights even as it protects and nur- tures individuality and di’erence. And this is where the China-India comparison is so problematic, in- deed unconscionable. However one might like to mea- sure or evaluate China™s develop- ment successes, there is no way to discount the human cost of the party-made great famine that took some 35 million lives, a cultural re- volution that made enemies out of neighbours, a one child policy that devastated families and erased a generation or the violent, syste- matic repression of the Uyghur Muslim and Tibetan minorities. These were not unfortunate ex- cesses or the inevitable costs of de- velopment. These were and are the irredeemable instincts and predations of an authoritarian state, one which now denounces as ﬁhistorical nihilismﬂ any inter- pretations of the past that chal- lenge the party™s o“cial history. Conversely, while India™s democ- racy has been quarrelsome, cum- bersome and often dominated by elites, it has also opened social and political spaces for subordinate groups and has built a sense of shared identity and belonging in the world™s largest and most di- verse society. It has preserved in- dividual liberties, group identities and religious and thought free- doms, all the things that confer re- cognition on human beings. To even pose the question of a trade- o’ between these freedoms and the role they have played in build- ing a pluralistic nation and some cold, utilitarian calculus of ﬁdeve- lopmentﬂ not only does violence to the very idea of human agency and dignity but completely ab- stracts from the very di’erent so- cial and historical realities of India and China. There is a backslide Beyond these comparative argu- ments for democracy, one need look no further than the object les- son the BJP government has pro- vided to dismiss the authoritarian fantasy. The democratic backslid- ing has been clear. The G overn- ment has not only sought to cen- tralis e, insulate and personalis edecision-making but has also ag- gressively undermined the inde- pendence of democratic institu- tions and silenced and imprisoned Opposition voices, all in the name of nationalism and promoting de- velopment. Yet, the development track is dismal at best. While cor- porate business interests and the billionaire class have ‘ourished, the overall economy has sputtered and since COVID-19 has expe- rienced the worst contraction of any sizeable economy in the world. Demonetisation and the disastrous response to the second COVID-19 wave were not just in- stances of utter policy incohe- rence fuelled by the sycophancy and myopia that comes with an in- wardly focused government, but exposed a degree of callousness and arrogance rarely seen in a de- mocracy. On the social front, the pursuit of Hindutva Š a prototypi- cal variant of authoritarian ethnic nationalism Š has shaken India™s democratic norms and institution- al foundations and weaponis ed a politics of polarisation and demo- nis ation that threaten to unravel the social fabric of the nation.  Rather than look to China, it is time to defend the noise of Indian democracy.

Haitian police say 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colom- bian soldiers, killed the President at his residence  in Port-au-Prince early Wednesday. Most of them were ar- rested and some were killed in a gun battle . But key questions  Š who the mastermind was, what the motive was and how a group of armed foreigners could walk in- to a presidential residence, shoot him dead and exit  Š are yet to be answered. Moïse was at the centre of a pol- itical crisis that had shaken the country in recent months. His opponents claimed that his †ve-year-term came to an end on February 7 and demanded  his resig- nation. Moïse, who took over o“ce in February 2017, months after his disputed election in 2016, claimed that his term would be over only in February 2022. When the Opposition formed a parallel government, Moïse al- leged a coup and cracked down on them. Moïse came to power promising to strengthen Haiti™s institutions,  †x its economy, †ght corruption and stabilise governance. But he himself faced serious corruption allegations, his government could not hold the 2019 parliamentary elections and the economycontracted under his watch. The outbreak of COVID-19 made matters worse .Now, Haiti stares into an uncertain future. According to the Constitution, the President of the Supreme Court should take charge. But the Supreme Court chief died of COVID-19 last month. There is no legislature as the 2019 elections have been postponed. For now, interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph has taken charge. But Moïse had †red him two days before his death and nominated Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon, for the post. Mr. Joseph is now consolidating the government, but Mr. Henry has asked him to step down, signalling tha tanother political crisis is taking shape in the midst of  se-curity worries. This is not the time for  another power struggle. Haiti™s politicians and military should take  aphased approach of uncovering the truth, stabilising the country and ensuring the formation of a legitimate administration . The government™s immediate priority should be to get to the bottom of the assassination. If fo- reign nationals were involved in the attack, as the police have claimed, Haiti should get international help in the investigation. And Haitian leaders should not allow the vacuum left by Moïse™s assassination to destabilise  the country further. Part of the problems Haiti faces is i ts inability to hold free, fair and credible elections in time and ensure a peaceful transition of power. Interim Prime Minister Joseph, Mr. Henry and other leaders should come together and hold legislative and presi- dential elections at  the opportune time to ensure that a stable government with popular legitimacy is in plac eto address the myriad problems the country is facing. Murder of a President Haiti needs to hold legislative and presidential elections soon for a legitimate government It is quite disconcerting that the Supreme Court has been informed for the second time in two years that Section 66A of the IT Act, which was struck down as unconstitutional six years ago, is still being invoked by the police and in some trial courts. One can see why the Court deemed it ﬁa shocking state of a’airsﬂ when a pe- tition by the People™s Union  for Civil Liberties (PUCL) came up for hearing. Section 66A made messages deemed by the police to be o’ensive or menacing to anyone, or those that caused ﬁannoyanceﬂ, a criminal o’ence if these were sent through a computer or com- puter resource. It prescribed a prison term of up to three years on conviction. In its landmark judgment in Shreya Singhal (2015), the Court ruled that the provi- sion was vague and violated the freedom of free speech. It was so broadly de†ned that it took into its sweep pro- tected speech also, and therefore upset the balance bet- ween the exercise of the free speech right and the impo- sition of reasonable restrictions on it. In January  2019, too, the C ourt™s attention was drawn to the same pro- blem of the invalidated provision being used by the pol- ice to register cases based on complaints. Not much seems to have changed since then, and it is quite sur- prising that the police headquarters and prosecutors in the various States had not disseminated the e’ect of the Court ruling among o“cers manning police stations. There were also instances of courts framing charges under Section 66A even after lawyers had cited the 2015 judgment. The PUCL has said as many as 745 cases are still pending in district courts in 11 States. It is not di“- cult to surmise that police o“cers who receive com- plaints and register them as First Information Repor ts may not be aware of the judgment, though one cannot rule out instances of the section being invoked deliber- ately as a tool of harassment. Ignorance of the law is no excuse for the citizen, and it must equally be no excuse for police o“cers who include invalidated sections in FIRs. Recently, police  in Uttar Pradesh booked a jour- nalist for defamation under Section 500 of the IPC, even though the Supreme Court has ruled that defama- tion can be pursued only by way of private complaints and there can be no FIR. The current hearing may re- sult in directions to  States and the polic e, as well as the court registries, for appropriate advisories to both  sta- tion-house o“cers and magistrates, but it is not neces- sary for those concerned to wait for such orders. Police chiefs and the directorates of prosecution must proac- tively begin a process of conveying to the lower cou rts and investigators all important judgments and their ef- fect on the practices relating to investigation, pro secu- tion and the framing of charges from time to time. Undead section The invalid Sec.66A is often invoked out of ignorance, but serves as a tool of harassment corrections & clarifications:  The front-page lead story titled ﬁAmid Cabinet reshuše buzz, eight States get new Gov-  ernorsﬂ (July 7, 2021) referred to Mr. K. Hari Babu as a former MP  and former BJP president of the erstwhile combined State of  Andhra Pradesh. Actually, he was the president of the State unit of  the Andhra Pradesh BJP post bifurcation in 2014.

A narrow highway which cuts through the Pir Panjal mountain range and snakes through the 2.85-km-long tunnel near Banihal connects  the Dogri- speaking Hindu population with the Kashmiri-speaking Muslim population.  Given that the Kashmir Valley  is prone to landslides, shooting stones and heavy snow, a tradition began, 149 years ago, of shifting the capital of Jam- mu and Kashmir (J&K) to Srinagar dur- ing summers and to Jammu during win- ters. The ‚Darbar Move™, which brought two linguistically and culturally di†e- rent regions closer, was entirely depen- dent on the vagaries of weather. Today, this tradition is likely to be- come history after the Lieutenant-Go- vernor™s administration decided to shift to e-o“ces this month. The administra- tion says the epic bi-annual move is too costly and takes up precious time and resources. But the decision has left hun- dreds of families worried that  their de- cades-old links with families across the mountains may fade away. Students are concerned about losing opportunities; traders about losing pro‘ts. Some sus- pect that the move has a larger motive. Sharing of cultures Notwithstanding the distance and the di†erence in culture and language, Chasfeeda Shah, 30, a media profes- sional from Kashmir™s Hyderpora, and Maanya Sethi, 26, a human resource manager from Jammu™s Gandhi Nagar, grew up seeing the Shahs and the Sethis as one family since 1983. A chance meet- ing between Chasfeeda™s father Bashir Ahmad Shah, a police o“cer, and Maa- nya™s grandfather Surinder Sethi, a Sec- tion O“cer in the Irrigation Depart- ment, in Jammu city transformed into a bond and the Sethis and Shahs became one extended family.  ﬁI was posted in Jammu during the Darbar Move in 1983 and met Sethi  sa- hib . Since then, we have stuck together through thick and thin. Sethi  sahib  met with an accident in the 1990s. I shifted him to hospital and stayed by his side till he recovered. Thereafter, we celebrated weddings, Eid and Diwali together ,ﬂ Shah says. Maanya is a fan of Kashmiri ‚waz- wan™, an array of meat dishes served at Kashmiri weddings, and Chasfeeda de- veloped a sweet tooth for the famous sweets of Jammu, also known as a city of temples. ﬁI was introduced to ‚wazwan™ dishes when the Shahs invited our fami- ly on Eid many years ago. I  got hooked to minced meat dishes like  Rista  and Gushtaba . I love spending summer vaca- tions at the Shahs™ house in Srinagar. Ours is a relationship that cannot be ex- pressed in words. When my grandfather passed away, Bashir  sahib booked a ’ight so he wouldn™t miss the ‘nal rites,ﬂ Maanya says. For Chasfeeda, born in con’ict-rid- den Kashmir,  shifting to Jammu meant six months of normal life, away from bomb blasts and frequent exchange of ‘re. She ‘rst entered a cinema hall in Jammu because all the cinemas were closed in Kashmir in the 1990s. ﬁThe ‘rst movie I watched was  Hum Saath- Saath Hai in Apsara cinema hall in Jam- mu™s Gandhi Nagar. In Jammu, I would attend coaching classes conducted by a Kashmiri Pandit teacher and eat with- out any fear on the roadside. I like Jam- mu weddings Š they™re loud and grand unlike those in Kashmir,ﬂ Chasfeeda says. In July, when the Lieutenant-Gover- nor administration issued a directive asking all the employees associated with the Darbar Move to vacate their ’ats within three weeks, without citing any reason,  Chasfeeda was upset. In Jam- mu, Maanya felt the same way.  ﬁI will miss the Shahs if the Darbar Move stops,ﬂ she says. This is not  the ‘rst time that the Dar- bar Move has come under a cloud. In Ja- nuary 1987, during his visit to J&K, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was strand- ed in Kashmir due to heavy snowfall while the capital was in Jammu. ﬁGand- hi asked the Farooq Abdullah govern- ment to have a re-look at this practice because o“cials were unavailable when they were needed in Kashmir during winters. However, an agitation started by the Chamber of Commerce and In- dustries-Jammu and the Jammu Bar As- sociation forced the government to keep the tradition,ﬂ  says former Direc- tor General of Tourism, Saleem Beg, who has continued to visit Jammu every winter since the 1970s, and even after his retirement. Acommittee formed in 1987, headed by the then Chief Secretary, Shiekh Ghulam Rasool, submitted a report tit- led ‚Darbar Move: The Reality™ to the go- vernment, to place before it the pros and cons of the practice. But the report was put on the back burner after the Jammu agitation. ﬁThe process of shifting hundreds of ‘les and employees ran smoothly. It al- ways connected people, regions and cultures,ﬂ Beg says. Aweek-long carnival  The Hindu Dogra rulers from Jammu ex- panded their boundaries up to Afghan- istan in the 19th Century, but most of them preferred to stay in the Valley. It was in 1872 that Maharaja Ranbir Singh began the practice of shifting his go- vernment from Jammu to Srinagar in summers, taking the arduous journey along the Banihal Cart Road. ﬁDogra rulers popularised the pa- pier-mâché artwork of Kashmir in many Jammu structures and the architectural elements of the Dogra Raj are visible in monuments in  Srinagar such as the Sher Garhi Palace. Dogra ruler Pratap Singh was so impressed by Kashmir™s calligra- phy that he started an annual award for calligraphy artists,ﬂ says Beg. The Dogra rulers set up  key institu- tions like J&K™s ‘rst museum and the Oriental Research Library in Srinagar. ﬁEven the Royal Samadhi is in Srinagar. The Dogra Maharajas preferred to be called as Kashmir™s kings and contribut- ed a lot to the Valley™s socio-economic development ,ﬂ Beg says .Zafar Choudhary, a Jammu-based writer and author of the book,  Kashmir Con†ict and Muslims of Jammu , goes to the extent of saying that the  Dogra rul- ers were biased towards Kashmir. ﬁThe ‘rst power project of J&K was set up in Uri in the Valley so that the King™s pa- lace could be well lit in Srinagar. No such project came up in Jammu despite the Chenab river ’owing through it. When Maharaja Gulab Singh, the foun- der of the modern but di“cult State of J&K, stepped down for his son, Ranbir Singh, he decided to live the last four years of his life in Kashmir as its Gover- nor,ﬂ Choudhary says .The Dogra Maharaja used hundreds of carts driven by horses and elephants to move to Srinagar through the treacherous stretch connecting  Jammu and Kashmir. Cut to 2019: ‘les and re- cords, many loaded in hard drives and computers, took about a week to move to the capital via trucks and buses. A to- tal of 151 government departments used to shift capital twice a year in J&K. ﬁAll the departments would ‘rst bun- dle their ‘les and seal them and then stock them in tin trunks. A team of ev- ery department would head for the cap- ital where everyone would be shifting .On arrival of the trucks, the teams would identify the trunks and unload them and place the ‘les in the respec- tive departments,ﬂ Beg recalls.  According to the o“cials of the J&K Estates Department, it took 152 trucks and 56 buses in April  2019 to ferry ‘les and employees from Srinagar to Jam- mu. The August 5, 2019 decision to end J&K™s special status, along with the CO- VID-19 pandemic, disrupted the Darbar Move in 2020 and 2021 .According to o“cial ‘gures,  10,112 employees had moved to Jammu, in- cluding 1,179 gazetted o“cers, 7,110 non-gazetted employees and 1,823 Class IV employees, in April 2019. ﬁWhile the loading and unloading of ‘les cost š45.41 lakh, the carriage cost š116.55 lakh. The Darbar Move cost about š1,636.04 lakh, besides the additional expenditure of š1,213.44 lakh as special allowance to the employees,ﬂ an o“cial of the Estates Department says, on the condition of anonymity.  The Darbar Move, which took place twice a year  Š in October/November to Jammu and in April/May to Srinagar Š would take two weeks of working days. From the Raj Bhavan to the Chief Minis- ter™s Secretariat to the Chief Justice™s of- ‘ce, the shifting of the capital was like  aweek-long carnival. It cost around š198 crore in 2019 to keep the tradition alive, o“cials say. According to the Estates Department ,151 private houses, 125 J&K Tourism De- partment Corporation structures and 1,457 hotels were booked for shifting employees to Kashmir, while 69 private houses, 253 J&K Tourism Department Corporation structures and 2,387 hotels were booked in Jammu. Arranging for accommodation cost the exchequer š4,161 lakh in Srinagar and š2,053.99 lakh in Jammu in 2019. Under the scanner of the court  It was this ﬁexpenditure, wastage of time and the labourﬂ that caught the at- tention of the J&K High Court in May 2020 while it was hearing a petition on the Darbar Move and the ongoing pan- demic. A Division Bench of the court comprising then Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rajnesh Oswal directed the Secretary, Ministry of Home A†airs, Go- vernment of India, and the Chief Secre- tary of J&K ﬁto examine the issues raised by the courtﬂ. Monika Kohli, amicus curiae, argued against the Darbar Move. ﬁJammu and Srinagar are well connected by air, road and rail service. The distance of about 300 km is covered in half an hour by ’ight. It is clearly logical that the consid- eration of extreme weather in support of the Darbar Move does not hold weight today,ﬂ she  said.Abattery of lawyers also questioned the security of records that were  being ferried from one place to another. ﬁSen- sitive documents and old archives can- not tolerate exposure of any kind. Such documents may be on matters of secur- ity of the country as well as of the Union Territory. This security ought not be compromised for any reason whatsoev- er,ﬂ Kohli said. Chief Justice Mittal, who was im- pressed by the arguments, called for ra- tionalisation of the tradition. ﬁThe amount of money, resources and time which could be saved could be utilised towards the welfare and development of the Union Territory, which has other- wise witnessed much turmoil. The ‘- nancial savings and resources could be utilised for contributing towards the protection and propagation of its inhe- rent culture and heritage of the com- munities,ﬂ she  observed. Beyond an emotional bond  The Darbar Move is not just an emotion- al bond between Kashmir and Jammu. Hundreds of students leave turmoil-hit Kashmir Valley to go to Jammu to seek admission into educational institutes and coaching centres. Retailers in Jam- mu procure special stocks for the 10,000 employees and their families and friends who mill around  Jammu for six months. Naresh Katoch, sales manager of the famous sweet shop, Pahalwan Di Hatti, at Jammu™s Wave Mall,  says his shop has traditionally attracted buyers from Kashmir during winters. ﬁSales would see a jump when Kashmiris would stay in Jammu. Kashmiris have a special pre- ference for Sund Panjeeri, Kala Kand, Chana Murgi and chocolate bars and would take huge stocks back to Srina- gar, where we don™t have an outlet,ﬂ Ka- toch says. Similarly, Jammu™s Khati Ka Talab area has become a hub of pink tea sell- ers . ﬁKashmiris prefer pink tea or noon chai (salty tea) and special morning bread. From just two to three shops in the 1980s, there are over a dozen shops serving the tea,ﬂ says Niyaz Ahmad, a shopkeeper who shifted from  Ramban area to Khati Ka Talab in the 1980s and managed to set up a buzzing tea business. ﬁThe Darbar Move, if it was a practice in the West, would have been an annual festival and would probably have eve- ryone participating, even  outsiders; it would be used to showcase the unique- ness of the region. But here it™s mired in politics and confusion. The fact remains that there is no viable alternative to the practice so far. Can J&K a†ord an admi- nistrative capital somewhere between Jammu and Srinagar,ﬂ Choudhary asks. He says many leading retail shops in Jammu have stopped buying fresh stocks now that the pandemic has dis- rupted the practice . ﬁ Shopkeepers would procure special stocks in Septem- ber for the Kashmiris who would travel and stay here for six months,ﬂ he says .Arun Gupta, who heads the Chamber of Commerce-Jammu, says the govern- ment will soon provide a clari‘cation about the move . ﬁThe tradition is not merely about shifting of ‘les but a living example of brotherhood. We will op- pose any move to end it. Shifting may cost the exchequer š200 crore but the fact remains that the people of Kashmir spend thousands of crores here and vice versa. It™s the job of the government to maintain brotherhood in J&K,ﬂ he says .Politics over the Darbar Move Three Jammu-based political parties Š the Bharatiya Janata Party, the J&K Na- tional Panthers Party, and Ikkjutt Jam- mu Š have welcomed the move to aban- don the practice. They see this as an end to Kashmir™s domination over the Civil Secretariat, the seat of governance in J&K. Kashmir-based parties have op- posed the  move. Choudhary says there were more Kashmiri employees than Jammu ones in the Secretariat in the 1950s and 1960s . ﬁThat gave birth to the notion that there was a bias against  Jammu ,ﬂ he says. The practice resulted in the region becoming a melting pot of cultures. Marriages took place between people from di†erent regions: Muslims from the Kashmir Valley, the Chenab Valley and the Pir Panjal Valley, otherwise sep- arated by mountains. It resulted in new cross-cultural Muslim colonies coming up in the surroundings of Jammu city. ﬁJammu has seen a new cultural land- scape with cross-cultural marriages. New colonies have come up. If the Dar- bar Move stops, people from the Che- nab Valley and the Pir Panjal Valley will feel like a part of them is not there,ﬂ Choudhary says. However, senior BJP leaders like Ka- vinder Gupta termed the end of the Dar- bar Move akin to the August 5, 2019 move, which took away the special con- stitutional position of J&K.  ﬁWe welcome it. The ‘rst priority is governance. There are e-o“ces in place now. It will not impact cultural interac- tion. Who has time to interact in this era of Internet and social media? The only issue is that the Jammu Civil Secretariat requires equal recruitment: about  70% of the recruits in the Secretariat  are from Kashmir. In fact, most of the high- er posts are occupied by the  people of Kashmir,ﬂ Ikkjutt Jammu president An- kur Sharma said. More than resolving the issue, the Lieutenant-Governor administration has ushered in new challenges for itself. Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader M.Y. Tarigami has asked the go- vernment to explain where  the Chief Se- cretary, the Director General of Police, and the administrative secretaries will function from. ﬁIf people have to meet any o“cer, where will they meet him or her? Where will the Assembly function from? Where will the Raj Bhavan be? There is no clarity on this issue,ﬂ Tariga- mi said. Many political analysts fear that the move will drive the wedge between the Kashmir and Jammu regions deeper, which could eventually result in their separation, the way Ladakh was carved out as a separate Union Territory on Au- gust 5, 2019. Gul Wani, head of the De- partment of Political Science at Kashmir University, is wary of the move. ﬁOn the face of it, it seems like a step towards good governance. But the fact remains that people from Kashmir see Jammu as asafe location to settle down and buy property. Most prefer to spend their earnings there. The old and ailing popu- lation, who cannot live in severe winters in Kashmir, prefer the warm weather in Jammu. In contrast, the people from Jammu are not able to settle down in Kashmir. The whole move has a conspi- racy angle to it. In Kashmir, conspira- cies are proven true with time,ﬂ he says .Meanwhile, hundreds of ‘les of the 97 departments, which include 47 Se- cretariat-based departments, have been digitised so far. The J&K e-o“ce project has scanned and digitised around two crore pages from 3.50 lakh ‘les, in a bid to end the practice of shifting the capi- tal. ﬁThe e-o“ce is one of the reforma- tive steps taken to put an end to the Dar- bar Move  in J&K, thus saving crores of rupees spent on transporting ‘les in hundreds of trucks,ﬂ Lieutenant-Gover- nor Manoj Sinha said earlier this month. In Srinagar™s Hyderpora, Chasfeeda is singing a lullaby to her 18-month-old daughter, Madiha. ﬁI am not sure now if the relationship between the Shahs and the Sethis will last through the next  gen- eration,ﬂ she rues, pointing towards the baby.
