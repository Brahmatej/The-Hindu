THE HINDU WEDNESDAY,JULY28,2021 6EDITORIALChange in Karnataka Politics in India, by and large, is either castecentric, cinema worlddriven or familyoriented. None can dispute that the Bharatiya Janata Party blossomed in Karnataka under Mr. Yediyurappa™s  leadership. His community, the Lingayats, has a strong presence in Karnataka and this fact cannot be ignored. It is a bit surprising that in his farewell speech he mentioned that the Centre did not give him a free hand to e†ectively discharge his duties and did not allow him to take independent decisions. V.

Relatively, the education sector has managed to maintain its revenue. Both schools and colleges have transitioned to the online education mode to serve their students. Under the pretext of providing online educa tion, most private institutions have managed to collect fees in full.  Survey and †ndings Though the revenue of private educational institutions has not ta ken a huge hit, the same cannot be said about the livelihoods of teach ers in private unaided colleges. During the novel coronavirus pan demic, layo†s and pay cuts have forced several privateunaided col lege teachers to take up odd jobs to provide for their families. The example of an assistant professor in Tamil Nadu who su†ered a pay cut in a  privateunaided college following the pandemic and who died while climbing a palm tree Š he had taken to cutting the leaves of palm trees to make a living Š pushed us to survey  privateunaid ed college teachers and to under stand the impact of the pandemic on their working and living condi tions. We surveyed 194 teachers working in privateunaided colleg es that are a’liated with the Un iversity of Madras, Chennai. The survey was conducted between June 13 and June 26, 2021. The  “ndings show that even be fore the pandemic, privateunaid ed college teachers received be lowpar salaries and many did not enjoy any social security bene“ts. Among 194 respondents, 137 ful “lled the University Grants Com mission (UGC) qualifying criteria (has Ph Dor National Eligibility Test or State Eligibility Test) to be an assistant professor; 72% of these quali“ed teachers received less than š 25,000 per month and 5.1% received less than š 10,000 per month, while according to the Seventh Pay C ommission entryle vel consolidated monthly salary for an assistant professor is š76,809. In our survey, we found that on ly 38% and 42% had Employee State Insurance and paid leave, respectively. This deplorable con dition of privateunaided college teachers can be attributed to the absence of any State regulation of private higher educational institu tions, including on matters relat ing to the working conditions of teachers and other employees.  Following neoliberal policies, the Indian state has withdrawn from providi ng higher education. This has resulted in the enormous growth of private higher educa tional institutions. According to the AllIndia Survey  on Higher Education (AISHE), 2020 report, at all India level, 65% of the total colleges are private unaided col leges. Tamil Nadu, which is  one of the few States that privatised high er education in the early 1980s, has 77% private unaided colleges. This shows the dominance of pro “tmaximis ing privateunaided colleges in higher education. Online education as  burden It is against this background that we must understand the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the li velihood of privateunaided col lege teachers. Privateu naided col lege teachers have made every e†ort to provide service to  stu dents in the online mode. In our survey, 88% of the respondents noted one or more of the following as the reason(s) for the di’culty they faced in online teaching Š lack of I nternet, lack of room/ space, and lack of quality equip ment. Further, every respondent had to incur an expenditure to purchase Internet service. Of the 194 teachers surveyed, 132 had to incur an expenditure to purchase one or more of the following items: a phone, computer, head phones. And, 107 respondents re ported experiencing high emo tional distress during this period linked to online teaching work. All these show that these teachers had to physically, emotionally, and monetarily exert themselves to provide online education during this pandemic. Despite this valo ris ing e†ort by  privateunaided college teachers, they have not been rewarded by their manage ment. Instead, they have been punished with  severe pay cuts dur ing the pandemic.The survey data revealed that through the “rst half of 202021, less than a  third of teachers re ceived the full salary they were en titled to. Sadly, 10% of our respon dents did not receive any salary during April to June 2020. As  col leges have transitioned to online mode, one can argue that the op erational costs of these colleges must have declined drastically. Further, it is a wellknown fact that private colleges have collected fees from students. Therefore, there is no justi“cation for reduc ing the salary of  teachers during this pandemic. Privateu naided colleges have used the pandemic as an excuse to rob teachers who have worked hard to teach under very di’cult conditions, incurring considerable monetary expenses and experiencing much stress dur ing this period. Making ends meet The arbitrary pay cuts have forced several of our respondents to work in additional jobs and/or borrow money from informal sources to survive. These jobs were mostly manual informal jobs such as con struction work , farm labour, me chanic work, food delivery, etc. While the pandemic may have worsened the livelihood condi tions of privateunaided college teachers, their working conditions were deplorable even in ‚normal™ times because of the complete ab sence of regulations by the State in this regard. The G overnment of Tamil Nadu should consider tak ing some immediate measures in this regard. Some of these are: pay complete arrears salary to private unaided college teachers that have been siphoned o† by the manage ment;r einstate teachers laid o† without any cause; reimburse the expenditure incurred by  teachers for online teaching during the pandemic.In 2018, Kerala “xed š1,750 per day and š43,750 per month as a standard salary for guest lecturers with UGC quali“cation and š1,600 per day and š40,000 per month for those without UGC quali“ca tion in aided private colleges. The Tamil Nadu government may con sider implementing something along these lines. Further, the Ta mil Nadu Private Colleges (Regula tion) Act 1976 needs to be re viewed and amended to equip monitoring agencies such as the Directorate of Collegiate Educa tion and the Regional Joint Direc torate of Collegiate Education to safeguard the welfare of teachers and nonteaching sta† in unaided private colleges.

Three meetings this month, of the Shanghai Coopera tion Organisation (SCO) contact group on Afghanistan and SCO De fence Ministers in Tajikistan, and the Central and South Asia confe rence on regional connectivity in Uzbekistan, are turning  the  spot light on the region™s role in dealing with the situation in Afghanistan, and how India could build on that. Factoring in the Taliban Put plainly, events of the past few years, and the decisions of the Troika have kept India out of a leading role in Afghanistan. Since 2019, the Troika has met with Pa kistan (Troika plus) in order to dis cuss Afghanistan™s future, one in which the Taliban Š with which New Delhi has had no ties  Š gains an important if not controlling role in Kabul. The same powers that invaded Afghanistan post 9/11, and declared the Taliban leader ship as United Nations Security Councildesignated terrorists, are now not only advocating talks with the Taliban, entreating their Pakis tani hosts of the past two decades to help, but actively paving the way for the Taliban™s return to power. India™s e†orts to build on trade with Afghanistan, shore up deve lopment projects and increase educational and training oppor tunities for Afghan youth have been appreciated, but these can not grow bigger due to a number of factors. New Delhi™s original hesitation in opening talks with the Taliban, which even Afghanis tan President Ashraf Ghani had suggested, has cut India out of the current reconciliation process. The end of any formal dialogue between India and Pakistan since 2016 and trade since 2019, have re sulted in Pakistan blocking India™s overland access to Afghanistan. India™s alternative route through Chabahar, though operational, cannot be viable or coste†ective also long as U.S. sanctions on Iran are in place. India™s boycott of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2017, and now tensions at the Line of Actual Control after the Chinese aggression in 2020, make another route to Afghanistan o†li mits.  Meanwhile, the U.S.  has an nounced a new, surprise forma tion of a ﬁQuadﬂ on regional con nectivity Š U.S.UzbekistanAfghanistanPa kistan that does not include India, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting trial runs of truck convoys from Tashkent to Karachi and back. With so many doors slamming shut, the hope is that the Central Asian window, with the ﬁStansﬂ (as the “ve Cen tral Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Taji kistan and Uzbekistan are some times referred to) will open new possibilities, but here too, there are some caveats. Uzbekistan™s view To begin with, it is clear that Tash kent (Uzbekistan) sees the rise of the Taliban in a di†erent light from New Delhi. After a whirlwind round of negotiations in his own region since coming to power in 2016, where he mended relations and ended border disputes with each of the other Central Asian States, and outreaches to the U.S. and China to shift the traditional tilt towards Moscow,  Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has made purposeful moves on Af ghanistan. In 2018, his govern ment became one of the “rst coun tries to publicly invite a Taliban delegation from Doha, Qatar to vi sit, while at the same time he has promoted a number of ambitious trade and connectivity initiatives with the Ashraf Ghani government. Apush for connectivity Speaking at the Central and South Asia conference in July, Mr.  Mirzi yoyev spelt out his plans for a modern version of the ﬁthe an cient northern trade route known as the Uttara Patha, connecting the IndoGanges Plain with the southern territories of the Eura sian continent through the histori cal cities of Takshila, Gandhara and Termez.ﬂ He spoke of the old Silk Routes that once bound Cen tral and South Asia together, and called Afghanistan the key link in ﬁpractical connectivityﬂ for them. Signi“cantly, while he mentioned the salience of the TermezMazar iSharifKabulPeshawar railroad, the TransAfghan railroad to con nect to China™s BRI, and the Inter national North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) via the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas as key ele ments of the ﬁarchitecture of con nectivityﬂ, he did not mention the Chabahar route that India has es poused. The UzbekistanPakistan memorandum of understanding on Transit Trade Š or the Agree ment between Uzbekistan and Pa kistan on Transit Trade (AUPTT) Š was also signed the same day, which would give Uzbekistan ac cess to the Pakistani seaports of Gwadar and Karachi, rather than Iranian ports. Uzbekistan™s calculations, and by extension, those of its other Central Asian neighbours, are three fold: the “rst is that prosper ity for these landlocked countries can only ‘ow from access through Afghanistan to the closest ocean, i.e. the Indian O cean. Second, that all transit through Afghanistan de pends on guarantees of safe pas sage from the Taliban, backed by the group™s mentors in Pakistan. Third , each of the ﬁStansﬂ are now apart of China™s BRI , and tying their connectivity initiatives with Beijing™s will bring the double pro mise of investment and some modicum of control over Pakistan.  Shared concerns Given the odds, New Delhi™s room for manoeuvre with these “ve countries on Afghanistan appears limited but not without hope. To begin with, India and the Central Asian S tates share common con cerns about an Afghanistan over run by the Taliban and under Pa kistan™s thumb: the worries of battles at their borders, safe ha vens for jihadist terror groups in side Afghanistan and the spillover of radicalism into their own coun tries.  It is necessary for India to work with them, and other neighbours to shore up “nances for the go vernment in Kabul, particularly to ensure that the government struc ture does no t collapse. It is only a matter of time before the CO VID19 weary international econo mies tire of funding Afghanistan, as the last donors conference in Geneva (November 2020) showed.  As part of the SCO™s Regional AntiTerrorist Structure (RATS), India must also step up its engage ment with the Central Asian coun tries on “ghting terror. While the Narendra Modi government has made it clear it will not send In dian boots to the ground in Af ghanistan, it can support the Af ghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) where it needs it most: in terms of air pow er. India™s previous gift of a few helicopters is far from adequate, given commitments made as Af ghanistan™s “rst Strategic Partner 10years ago, and there must be more that New Delhi can support, especially in conjunction with oth er countries that depend on So vietmade arms, including heli copters and planes, weaponry, ammunition and spare parts.  Dealing with Pakistan Finally, South Asia must learn from Central Asia™s recent exam ple in knitting together this region more tightly, a task that can only be completed with better ties bet ween India and Pakistan. New Del hi™s furtive discussions with the Taliban leadership in Doha make little sense unless a less tactical and more strategic engagement with Pakistan is also envisaged.  Most importantly, countries of Central Asia and South Asia need to “nd a more uni“ed voice, as they have in recent weeks. Afghan istan™s future will a†ect both re gions much more than it will the distant global powers that current ly dominate the debate.  Travelling to Kazakhstan in 2015, Prime Minister Modi spoke of why the Silk Road that connect ed the two regions faded away. ﬁThe end of the Silk Road did not just come about from the rise of seabased trade of the new Euro pean powers,ﬂ he said, ﬁIt also happened because Central Asia was no longer a bridge between re gions, but the new fault line bet ween great empires to the east, west and south.ﬂ Ensuring a simi lar rupture is not wrought in Af ghanistan is essential, which today has the potential to become that bridge or the biggest boulder bet ween Central and South Asia. suhasini.h@thehindu.co.in Needed, a more uni†ed Asian voice for Afghanistan Afghanistan™s future will impact Central Asia and South Asia more than the distant global powers involved with it now Suhasini Haidar APTunisian President Kais Saied™s decision to sack the Prime Minister and suspend Parliament, amid wi despread antigovernment protests, has trig gered the worst political crisis in the country since the Arab Spring protests. Among the  countries a†ected by the Arab street protests, Tunisia was the only one that managed to successfully transition from dictatorship to parliamentary democracy. But the North African coun try™s elected rulers never managed to ease its economic woes, or o†er stable governance. Tunisia has had nine governments since 2011, with its  crisishit economy be ing  battered further by the COVID19 outbreak Š last year, its GDP contracted by 8.8% in real terms. The trig ger now is the  government™s poor handling of the pan demic. The country of 11.8 millionhas recorded nearly 18,000 COVID related deaths so far Š one of the highest per capita death rates in the world. Only 7% of the pop ulation are fully vaccinated. Last week, the govern ment™s move to speed up vaccination by opening it for all above 18 years ended  in stampedes and violent inci dents . Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi sacked the Health Minister , but  public anger refused to subside. On July 25, Tunisia™s Republic Day, protests broke out and the o’ces of the ruling party, Ennahda,  stormed. This allowed the President  to sack the government. President Saied says he stepped in to ﬁsave the stateﬂ. But in a country where the wounds of decadeslong dic tatorship are yet to heal, his move to dissolve an elected government would raise concerns rather than  comfort. Both the President and Parliament are popularly elect ed. Mr.  Mechichi had the backing of Ennahda, the lar gest party in the suspended Parliament. President Saied, who is an independent, has had a testy relation ship with Ennahda and the Prime Minister. While the Mechichi government has clearly failed in tackling the COVID19 pandemic , the President™s move to dissolve Parliament appears morea power grab than a genuine attempt to address the country™s problems. Ennahda and at least two other parties have accused Mr. Saied of orchestrating a coup. If they resort to protests, it would pitch the parties that control Parliament against the President, deepening political instability. The 2014 Constitution has called for a constitutional court to set tle crises like these, but the court has not been formed yet. Under the Constitution, the President oversees on ly the military and foreign a†airs, while the Prime  Mi nister is in charge of the daytoday a†airs of gover nance. So to avoid a constitutional crisis, the President will have to appoint a Prime Minister, who should wi nthe con“dence of the Assembly of the People™s Repre sentatives. Mr. Saied should act within his constitution al limits, recall Parliament and allow the formation of a legitimate government, which could take steps to ad dress Tunisia™s economic and healthcare woes .Crisis in Tunis  Parliament™s suspension  seems a power grab by President, not a response to public anger Following a dangerous and avoidable escalation of an otherwise dormant border dispute, “ve police men and a civilian from Assam were killed in the Mizo border town of Vairengte in clashes between pol ice from the State and their counterparts in Mizoram ,on Monday. The sequence of events, beginning October 2020, suggests that what began as skirmishes between residents  close to the disputed border between Assam™s Cacharand Mizoram™s Kolasib districts has snowballed into a violent confrontation between police and  resi dents. The events point to a failure of the constitutional machinery, empowered to deescalate tensions at the border. The presence of central paramilitary forces should have helped maintain the peace, but it is cu riously not the case. Besides, Assam and Mizoram are governed by the BJPand its ally, the Mizo National Front, respectively, and are part of  NorthEast Demo cratic Alliance, of which the Assam Chief Minister, Hi manta Biswa Sarma, is a founderconvenor. The politi cal bonhomie should have allowed the respective Chief Ministers to tamp down border tensions and to return to the status quo through joint fact“nding teams, in volving the administrative o’cials in maintaining the peace over the border issue. Instead, both Chief Minis ters have been exchanging  allegations  on Twitter, seek ing the intervention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and usingvideos to tell a story that suited their version of the events Ša farcical means of communica tion. This also occurred just days after both Chief Minis ters (along with others) met with Mr. Shah to discuss the resolution of interState border disputes . The unfor tunate loss of lives has led to hardened stances, with Mr. Sarma announcing that Assam would deploy ﬁ4,000 commandos to guard its borderﬂ , even as Mizoram™s Chief Minister Zoramthanga has maintained that the ca sualties followed from the Assam police™s actions. Sectarian tribalism has been the bane of the North eastern States, with underdevelopment acting as a cata lyst in complicating knotty issues over  land and other issues in the region. There is no sureshot and quick so lution possible to the border disputes between various States without a spirit of give and take and a civic en gagement brokered by the Union government. But for that to happen, governments should, “rst, not condone violence of any kind and restrain partisans engaging in such activity in their respective States. A resort to one upmanship will only prolong the disputes and harden stances. The Home Ministry must  ensure that the As samMizoram border situation is “rst subject to dee s calation and steps taken to return to the status quo that prevailed before the skirmishes began in October 2020 with the cooperation of the respective States .Dangerous con†agration The clash between Assam and Mizoram™s police forces was clearly avoidable

THE HINDU VISAKHAPATNAM
WEDNESDAY,JULY28,2021 7OPEDSubInspector Bula Singh™s appeal against his conviction for bribery was rejected in the Sessions Court today [Amritsar, July 26]. In an elaborate judgment dealing minutely with the facts of the case the Sessions Judge †nds that the direct evidence of witnesses as to demanding and payment of bribe is cor rect and reliable, and that circumstantial evidence clearly supports the statement of direct witnesses and that the o“ence charged against the applicant has been clearly established. As to the sentence the Sessions Judge says:  Considering the appli cant™s certi†cates of character and his posi tion, responsibility and duty as a SubIn spector in charge of a Police station, the sentence passed by the Lower Court is suita ble viz. nine months rigorous imprisonment and Rs. 1,000 †ne or in default three months rigorous imprisonment. The accused has however been admitted to bail of Rs. 5,000 by the High Court, Lahore, pending the deci sion of the revision application. AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 28, 1921 Alleged bribery ﬁThere are no words in the German language for this devastation... it is a surreal, eerie situation,ﬂ  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said when she visited the regions in Germany hardest hit by the ‘oods which oc curred as a result of heavy rains bet ween July 12 and 15 .No escape for any country Amonth™s rain poured in just 24 hours in the worsta“ected areas of Germany and Belgium. This caused multiple rivers to burst their banks and ‘ood parts of the two countries as well as the Netherlands, Luxem bourg and Switzerland. It is believed that these areas of Europe have not witnessed such heavy rainfall  for more than a century. The ‘oods showed that climate change spares none. Even if a  country has  adequate resources and advanced infrastruc ture (physical as well as organisation al), it can †nd no escape from ex treme climatic events. Reports say the death toll in Germany and Belgi um has crossed 214. Hundreds more are unaccounted for, and authorities are still struggling to restore normal cy. A shocked ‘ood victim told a re porter that he thought  such disasters happened only in Asia. Heavy  rainfall within a short pe riod of time resulted in over‘owing rivers, canals, and other water bo dies ‘ooding many towns and cities .The scenes of roads being washed away, houses getting inundated, and stranded people being evacuated by helicopters, earth movers and life boats were no di“erent from what is normally witnessed in India during such disasters. It  bore uncanny re semblance to what Kerala  expe rienced in August 2018. Not surpris ingly,  Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reacted to the situation in Eu rope. He  expressed condolences and asked the Indian community in Eu rope to stand in solidarity with the ‘ood victims. He also recalled with gratitude the technical assistance ex tended by the Netherlands to the State following the 2018 ‘oods and the visit of the Dutch King and Queen to Kerala in 2019 when they perso nally reviewed the joint e“orts under way for longterm ‘ood resilience. Superior organisation, better pre paredness and an advanced ‘ood management system helped the Netherlands, with its centuries of ex perience in dealing with ‘oods, to avoid casualties. But many towns were submerged. Thousands of peo ple had to be evacuated. Floodwaters breached a dike and entered the town of Meerssen. The Dutch mili tary, however, managed to close the breach using hundreds of sandbags. Chancellor Merkel, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and other lead ers were quick to attribute the cause of the ‘oods to climate change and call for urgent action to arrest global warming. Experts say the more CO 2the world emits into the atmosphere, the warmer will be the air tempera ture. Warmer air holds more mois ture and results in excess rainfall, which leads to ‘ooding. Additionally, increasing temperatures at the poles result in slower movement of storms in the midlatitudes. As a result, storms linger longer at a speci†c place. The combination of a slow moving storm and the presence of surplus moisture in the atmosphere results in intense rainfall in one loca tion within a short period of time. In 2018, Kerala, for example, witnessed 414 mm of rain in just three days bet ween August 15 and 17. Rainfall for the period of August 1 to 19, 2018, in Kerala was 164% more than normal. Several have asked: what did the Netherlands do right in dealing with the ‘oods and what did the others do wrong?  The advanced ‘ood warning system of Germany (which includes a network of sensors to measure river water levels in real time) did forecast heavy rains and the possibility of ‘oods. But local authorities were un able to respond rapidly enough and communicate the warnings to the wider population. The rain and ‘oods happened so fast that there was no time to evacuate all residents to safety and fully deploy the formid able rescue and relief infrastructure that they possessed. There are alrea dy demands that such warnings must be communicated to the general pu blic in simple language. Rather than forecast the millimetres of rain ex pected, conveying speci†c informa tion regarding the extent of damage to property and life would likely  en courage a“ected communities to re main alert and respond quickly. Lessons for India The ‘oods in Europe call attention to the global need for  countries to im plement ecologically sensitive ‘ood protection measures. The Dutch have gone beyond their conventional dependence on dikes, dams, walls and gates to protect themselves from ‘oods. Their current disaster resi lience mantra is to live with water, build with nature and make room for the river. They champion creating adequate space for rivers to over‘ow by protecting ‘oodplains from hu man interference, deepening river beds and creating alternate channels for excess water. After two major ‘oods in 1993 and 1995, the Dutch embarked on several projects to wi den riverbanks and reshape the areas around rivers.  The ‘oods in Europe serve as a wakeup call to us in India to adopt pragmatic policies and practices that are nature friendly. We must recog nise that we will have to learn to live with water in the long term. Flood prone areas should be identi†ed, and projects initiated on an urgent basis to create room for rivers. Lowrisk areas such as  playgrounds, maidans, or agricultural †elds should be ear marked to store excess rainwater. Drains must be built for diverting wa ter into these storage units. This will relieve the stress on the existing drainage infrastructure. The stored water can later be discharged back into the drainage channel once the high water subsides. The United Na tions Development Programme World BankEuropean Union Post Disaster Needs Assessment report prepared for Kerala after the 2018 ‘oods pointed out that the drainage capacity of the rivers and canals of the State must be increased by creat ing more room for the water to ‘ow. It called for removing obstructions and encroachments from existing water channels, the proper mainte nance of such channels and creating additional channels for water to ‘ow. In the short term, strengthened disaster readiness, planning and preparation will help us deal with sudden, intense rain and consequent ‘oods. Climate change and global warming will continue to cause ex treme climatic events. Across the world, countries are being confront ed with situations of either too little or too much water and droughts in terspersed with ‘oods. Rainfall has become  unpredictable. While na tional and State disaster manage ment authorities have grown in expe rience, competence and professionalism, there is need for a higher degree of coordination and preparation across all levels of go vernment. Practice drills need to be conducted in ‘oodprone areas. We need to test the e“ectiveness of ‘ood warnings. The warnings should be  inlocal languages and in simple terms .Today,  many are wondering  how they can learn from the Dutch expe rience in preparing for ‘oods and dealing with their aftermath. But the Dutch themselves are wisely not per mitting themselves any compla cence. Conscious of their vulnerabil ity to water, they maintain a spirit of eternal vigilance to ‘oods.  Re‘ecting this approach, the Dutch Prime Mi nister has exhorted his countrymen to learn from the recent disaster and see what more can be done rather than stay satis†ed that major damage and loss of lives was prevented.

Dalits are now shown as  courageous men performing fantastic heroic deeds . In Kabali , the Dalit is  the leader of Malaysian migrants. In  Kaala , he is the goodhearted ma†a don  who challenges the authority of the ruling class in Mumbai. In  Asuran , he is an angry man who uses  violence to protect his family against  feudal lords. In  Karnan, heis a village rebel who kills a police inspector in a revengeful act of justice. These are vio lent stories about Dalits™ social struggles, as pirations and quest for justice. In these †lms, the Dalit characters emerge as the equal clai mants of popular heroic virtues. Abeautiful metaphor In Pa Ranjith™s  Sarpatta Parambarai, the he ro Kabilan (Arya) stands distinct from  earlier Dalit protagonists. We see Kabilan †rst as a part of an  audience  at a boxing game. Then from an underdog boxer he overcomes  so cial obstacles to become the ultimate cham pion of the game. The †lm thus escapes the typical social burden of the Dalit hero and shows Kabilan as a young sportsperson who plays the game with dedication and grit. Ka bilan does not use violence for revenge. In stead, the competitive game of boxing emerges as a beautiful metaphor to repre sent social con‘icts, clan pride and personal passions. Kabilan is not a revengehungry young man but a committed disciple of his clan™s boxing coach Rangan (Pasupathy) and enters the ring only to protect the dignity of his people. Though the violence in the box ing ring showcases raw masculinity, it is util ised only to suggest that even ghettoised pe ople can enter into any game and emerge victorious. Kabilan™s punches demonstrate that human spirit and passion cannot be im prisoned by any class or community. The new Dalit hero as a n aggressive man is di“erent from the stereotypical representa tions of him as brutalised. However, these new †lms only change the social location of the conventional hero; they don™t  radically alter the idea of the popular hero. The Dalit hero appears as an improvised version of the mainstream hero as he is also depicted as a tormented man . Though these characters of ten play under the shadows of Dalit symbol slike B.R. Ambedkar™s photograph or Budd ha™s statue, we are yet to see an authentic portrayal of a Dalit protagonist who can re present Ambedkarite cultural aesthetics and Dalits™ political vision on screen.  The recent portrayals supplement the po pulist attributes of Tamil cinema and stand agnostic to Ambedkar™s political principles and social ethics. After the Russian revolu tion, while many western educated elites were in‘uenced by Marxist political ideology and wanted to test socialist ideas in Indian conditions, Ambedkar showed only a passive appreciation towards it. He appreciated the socialist, transformative agenda to address class inequality; however, he  disassociated himself from the advocates of revolutionary or anarchic violence against the state or the dominant elites. He understood that the Da lits were the most powerless among the Hin dus and any violent challenge to the ruling classes would only invite further alienation, subjugation and brutal repression. More than imagining a violent con‘ict bet ween the Dalits and  upper caste Hindus, Am bedkar wanted to build a democratic dia logue to achieve a better conception of the modern state and civil society. His primary task was to bring an enlightened conscious ness amongst the Dalits so that they can cherish their rights as citizens and claim va rious entitlements . Ambedkar™s greater goal was not to eliminate the social elites or de feat them in physical battles but to introduce the  ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity insociety. The Dalit social and political as sertion must be peaceful, ethical, and en gaged with the principles of social justice. In the postAmbedkar period, Kanshi Ram used constitutional and democratic apparatuses to mobilise the DalitBahujan people for bringing  about political change. However, such powerful †gures and their movements are yet to †nd respectable presence on the silver screen. Instead, the recent Dalit prota gonists we see are of macho males furiously †ghting evil caste supremacy .Ambedkar™s political ideas stand distinct from the violent masculinity that has been idealised in Indian cinema™s action genre. The emerging Dalit™s heroic avatar too ap pears as a tacit mimicry of the masculine male fantasy that mainstream Tamil cinema has produced all these years.  While there are Dalit characters in cinema now, most por trayals endorse the dominant cultural narra tive that celebrates hedonistic aspirations, militant violence and male superiority. The emerging Dalit cinematic genre can do better if it also challenges the populist narrative structure and liberates  cinema from its pa triarchal gaze.  Sarpatta Parambarai  is not an ideal addition here but  it is a promising move towards breaking the Dalit hero™s fan tasy for violence and revenge. Harish S. Wankhede is an assistant professor at the Centre for Political Studies, JNU, New Delhi Dalits™ “st of fury Recent portrayals of Dalits in cinema are agnostic to Ambedkar™s political principles and social ethics Harish S. Wankhede CC CCDATA POINT  Sita was 13 years old when she was tra’cked. Her parents worked in a tea garden in Assam for meagre wag es. She was tra’cked to a placement agency in New Delhi, and bought for about š20,000 as a domestic worker by a couple. Sita was not paid a single rupee. Instead, she was retra’cked, raped, and exploited by employers and tra’ckers. Sita™s father and I found the young girl trapped in a house in Delhi three years later. But she did not step out when we found her. She hid behind a wall, crying. ﬁI cannot show my face to my father. I am impure now. I want to kill my self,ﬂ she said.  This is the reality of thousands of women and children from the poor est sections of our society. No nation can call itself civilised if it tolerates the buying and selling of its daught ers. Of what meaning is the wealth, power or progress of a nation if its children are traded as though in me dieval slave trade, at a lower  price than cattle? Acomprehensive Bill Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) and various civil society groups have campaigned for decades for a strong law to end this menace of human tra’cking. In 2017, Sita and thou sands of survivors like her marched in the Bharat Yatra alongside stu dents, governments, the judiciary, multifaith leaders, businesses and ci vil society to demand for such a law. We covered 12,000 km with over 1.2 million people on foot with the single demand that India must pass a com prehensive antitra’cking legisla tion. The passionate chants of these brave hearts who survived tra’cking still reverberate in my ears, ﬁ Bikne ko taiyaar nahi hum, lutne ko taiyaar nahi hum (We are not ready to be sold, we are not ready to be stolen)ﬂ. The Government of India has pro posed the Tra’cking in Persons (Pre vention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021. This Bill aims to tackle all aspects of tra’cking including the social and economic causes of the crime, punishment to tra’ckers, and the protection and rehabilitation of survivors. This is achievable if the Bill has the necessary checks and balanc es against potential misuse of power by agencies, periodic reviews of the law,  and adequate allocation of re sources for e“ective implementation. The government must include these crucial provisions in the Bill and facil itate its smooth passage in the cur rent session of Parliament. Aproblem worsened by COVID COVID19 has further intensi†ed the need for the law. Tra’ckers are tak ing advantage of prolonged school closures and loss of family livelihood. BBA with government agencies has rescued almost 9,000 children from tra’cking since the †rst lockdown. In comparison, about half this num ber of children were rescued during the same time period of 14 months preceding the pandemic. The gravity of the situation cannot be under mined. We will not recover from the e“ects of the pandemic without the wherewithal to address its human impact, which comes with this law and its associated budgets. Human tra’cking is a crime in it self, but it is also the propeller of sev eral other crimes. It creates a parallel black economy which fuels child la bour, child marriage, prostitution, bonded labour, forced beggary, drug related crimes, corruption, terrorism and other illicit businesses. The ar chitects of our Constitution esta blished the severity of the crime of tra’cking by making it the only of fence punishable under the Constitu tion of India itself, besides untoucha bility. A strong antitra’cking law is the moral and constitutional respon sibility of our elected leaders, and a necessary step towards nationbuild ing and economic progress. It is non negotiable for the realisation of an In dia that our Constitutionmakers en visioned, our freedom †ghters struggled for, our soldiers die for, and our children deserve. India is step ping into its 75th year of Indepen dence. There can be no greater gift to India than the freedom of our  chil dren. I call on Parliament to urgently pass a strong antitra’cking law.

There is a short circuit somewhere in the engine™s elec trical system. If the engine had not †red, as tronauts David Scott, James Irwin and Alfred Worden would have abandoned the landing goal and conducted an alternate lunar orbit scienti†c mission. Mission Commander Da vid Scott sounded jubilant and relieved. Mis sion Control said the test proved that the trouble with the engine system was only so mething ﬁwhich might be a little annoying.ﬂ Slightly more than halfanhour before the †ring, Apollo15 passed the halfway point of its outward journey, when it was 209,354 km. from both earth and moon. Experts at Mission Control will need time to evaluate the engine burn. But Flight Director Glynn Lunney said earlier today that if the power plant †red as planned, the astronauts would press on with the landing.
