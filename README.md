THE HINDU FRIDAY,JULY23,2021 6EDITORIALOxygen scarcity claim The Centre™s claim in Parliament that there were no deaths in India due to a lack of oxygen during the COVID19 pandemic  is ludicrous (Page 1, ﬁGovt. claim on oxygenscarcity deaths is appalling, say expertsﬂ, July 22).  Shifting the blame on to the States on a mere technicality, when there was an unprecedented surge in oxygen demand during the second wave Š requiring the judiciary  to intervene Š shows a lack of sensitivity on the part of the Centre. This coming at a time when a U.S. study has said that India™s COVID19 toll may be close to 50 lakh ,makes it arguably the worst human tragedy since Partition and Independence.Dr. Thomas Palocaren, Vellore, Tamil Nadu nThe penchant for passing the buck and fudging †gures by the current dispensation is worrisome. Its  current claim on zero deaths due to oxygen scarcity is cruel. Policymakers tend to assume that the government only needs to provide people with clear information and that, once properly informed, they will automatically do the right thing. The projection of an idealised version of the country Š sanitised, curated, united, strong, in the face of manipulated content and modular malware Š leads one to ask: ‚Can the general public trust themselves to do the right thing?™ Anthony Joseph, New Delhi nThe Government is rubbing salt into the  wound of families who lost loved ones after the shortage of medical oxygen. The  images of serpentine queues of people waiting for oxygen re†lls and carrying  heavy cylinders on their shoulders are  indelible. Does the Government believe that citizens have amnesia? It is shocking to see the common to see this while travelling from Sirkali to Mayiladuthurai,  Mannargudi to Kumbakonam and then to Thanjavur . However, many such plots lie bare without any construction. Perhaps a law that reconverts the land to agricultural use if  nobuilding comes up within †ve years of having bought the land needs to be introduced. P. Mukuntharajan, ChennaiGovernment™s brazen attitude. Statements such as the one made in  Parliament dentthe credibility quotient of the government of the day.

Krishnan In the multitude of commentar ies that have appeared on the centenary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), analys ing its strength, skills and longevity, a crucial missing component is that of the status and role of the work ing class, whom the party claims to historically represent. In its 100 year journey from a revolutionary party to a governing party, the CPC has unfailingly asserted its identity as the ‚vanguard of the Chinese working class™. The cen tenary o“ers an opportunity to look at the reality of such asser tions, the actual conditions of the working class and its political sta tus in contemporary China.  An identi†cation with labour  While China™s labour history pre dates the formation of the C PC, go ing back to the late 19th century, the party™s formation in 1921 pro vided the ideological impetus and organis ational basis for the labour movement. The e“orts of the C PC, preceding the establishment of the People™s Republic in 1949, was to embed itself in the labour move ment, in line with its ideological political moorings of being the vanguard of the working class in the protracted struggle. Post 1949, under proletarian work ethic and socialist construction emphasis ed by Mao Zedong, there was prioriti sation of the modern industrial sector, especially heavy industry. Raising of wage levels, ensuring la bour protection and providing permanent employment were ac corded importance by the Party state.  Party organisations were creat ed in enterprises, as cadres forged concrete links with the industrial workers. Through a series of mass political campaigns, the Party state consolidated its control over industrial enterprises. In the pro cess, there was a change in the po sition and relationship of the work ers, as they participated in factory management and politics. Furth er, through the broad range of workplacebased welfare provi sions and services, a cradleto grave welfare system for the work ers and their dependents was created. This political empower ment of the workers as stakehol ders, albeit under the control and patronage of the CPC, created an ‚industrial citizenship™ (to quote sociologist Joel Andreas). Arealignment The turbulence and chaos in‘ict ed by the Cultural Revolution that shook China™s political and social order played a big part in charting the course of realignment and re prioritisation in the postMao pe riod, by Deng Xiaoping after 1978. Marketis ation Š although directed by the state Š was adopted as the economic strategy, though direct ed by the state, and conscious ef forts were undertaken to integrate China with the world economy. As the pace of economic reforms in creased, they vastly recast work place relations and labour politics by gradually disenfranchising the workers. As pro†t maximisation, e’ciency and economic competi tion became the buzzwords in pro reform advocacy, the permanent employment system was replaced with a labour contract system. Si milarly, reducing the power and in‘uence of workers, factory di rectors/enterprise managers were given vast powers and responsibil ities. Increasingly, preference was also given to technocrats, and management and business grad uates in appointments to middle and higherlevel leadership posi tions in enterprises, rather than workers who had come up through the ranks. Hundreds of workers considered redundant were laid o“ in lieu of monetary compensation through compulso ry retirement programmes. Parallel to this restructuring of public enterprises, there was ac tive promotion of private enter prises, involving both domestic and foreign capital. With the avail ability of uninterrupted supply of rural migrant labour and taking advantage of low labour costs, transnational corporations shifted their manufacturing operations o“shore to China. Bolstered by the preferential treatment provided by local governments, the burge oning exportoriented manufac turing with active supply chains, established its own model of em ployment relations, which was built on the expropriation of la bour. Despotic management, ex ploitative work conditions, coer cive discipline and surveillance are some of the characteristic fea tures of the work ecosystem. Vio lations of labour standards and rights are endemic. Resistance as a challenge With no tangible workercentric avenues for collective voice, work ers have resorted to the use of rad ical autonomous actions to vent out their grievances. Over the years, workers™ protests have re mained steady in China. The e x pansion of workers™ resistance has remained a political challenge for the Partystate. As maintenance of stability and industrial peace is considered essential for unhin dered economic production, the CPC has crafted responsive mea sures that can be seen as crisis mitigation. Aseries of prolabour pieces of legislation has been enacted, en couraging workers to use them to address con‘icts and grievances. In putting in place this ‚rule by law™ (also necessitated by the need for a legal framework upon Chi na™s entry into the World Trade Or ganization in 2001), the Partystate is able to individualise labour con ‘icts, thus continuing to thwart possibilities and avenues for auto nomous, coordinated, and dura ble collective mobilisations. Equal ly, it dualistically uses its responsive and repressive capaci ties Š welfare concessions on the one hand and ramping up public security apparatus as well as active use of force on the other Š to meet labour unrest. The topdown con cessions of the central Partystate also strategically shielded it from workers™ disa“ection, which in turn was directed towards em ployers and the local governments. Reforms versus social base The intensi†cation of the pace of economic reforms has impacted the CPC™s membership and cadre recruitment strategies. The tradi tional social base of the party Š peasantry and industrial proleta riat Š has been gradually shrink ing. There has been a steady ab sorption of new classes of entrepreneurs, urban profession als and university graduates. Des pite increasingly becoming the critical engines in China™s econom ic rise, the rural migrant workers remain largely excluded from  the party fold. The steady erosion of ‚industrial citizenship™, the grow ing precariousness of employment and increasing peripheralisation of workers is not an isolated phe nomenon with regard to China, as it coincided with the global neolib eral turn since the 1980s, that drastically changed employment relations across the world. The di minished status of workers is a grim reality and despite President Xi Jinping™s increasing reiteration of ideology, it is rooted in status quoism, shorn of any emancipato ry promise or politics for the work ing class. Anand P. Krishnan is a Visiting Associate Fellow, Institute of Chinese Studies, Delhi The diminishing status of the Chinese worker The centenary of the Communist Party of China is a chance to look at the status and role of the working class  APThe National Council of Edu cational Research and Train ing (NCERT) has tasked the State Councils of Educational Re search and Training  (SCERTs) to develop four State Curriculum Frameworks (SCFs). They pertain to School Education, Early Child hood Care and Education (ECCE), Teacher Education (TE) and Adult Education (AE). This is as in the re commendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 .At the †rst level, the NCERT will provide templates to the S tates to develop four draft SCFs, the drafts will feed into formulating the Na tional Curriculum Frameworks, or NCFs, and the †nal version of the NCFs will be used as guiding docu ments to †nalis e the SCFs. The SCERTs are also supposed to deve lop 25 position papers, which will be similarly used to develop na tional position papers. The cycle seems to be designed to take on board suggestions from all S tates, thereby making the NCFs repre sentative and inclusive docu ments. The NCERT will also pro vide support to the SCERTs in terms of guidance, training of per sonnel, and technology platforms to develop these documents.  Much data collection So far so good. But the NCERT will also provide etemplates for each of these tasks ﬁwhich will be †lled up by the States/UTs [Union Terri tories]ﬂ. Similarly, survey ques tionnaires/multiple choice ques tions, or  MCQs , will also be provided to conduct surveys among various stakeholders. Thus, massive data collection seems to be in progress. Such sur veys are designed, let us accept, with all good intentions to take on board views from all sections of the population. This is without doubt  a must in a democracy, par ticularly in matters of deciding the aims, the objectives, and the con tent of curriculum because it af fects everyone.  However, the gathering and the organis ation of such data to be used in curricular decisions re quires more than just good inten tions. The kind of questionnaires and templatethat one develops can emphasise certain kinds of re commendations while muting some others. Similarly, the clean ing and organising of the data may pick up what is already in the minds of the people handling such data and †lter out what does not †t within their thinking. Even if these two problems are somehow solved, the problem of what the majority ‚wants™ and what ‚ought to be™ done remains. For example, if one asks about public opinion on the medium of instruction for the ECCE, the overwhelming ma jority is likely to favour English. Does it mean this would be in the best interest of the children and society?  Some valid questions Ahuge opinion gathering exercise preceded NEP 2020. One wonders why this could not prevent it from becoming  a managerial policy geared to make education a train ing endeavour to produce a work force for market needs. The policy is chockablock with  words for va lues, capabilities and skills, all jus ti†ed as needed for  emerging mar ket requirements. Furthermore, these lists are just heaps of words, devoid of any organising principle to decide priorities, interrelation ships and deriving curricular con tent and pedagogy from them. A similar unorganised list is repeat ed  ad nauseum in the name of  pedagogical recommendations. And yet, it fails to provide appropriate criteria to choose pedagogy at dif ferent stages and for di“erent cur ricular areas.  The socalled foundational stage crumbles under the slightest scrutiny on organisational as well as pedagogical grounds. The ECCE plus C lasses one and two(†rst †ve years of education, for the age group threeyears to eight years) is proclaimed as one stage. But the ECCE and Classes one and two willbe run in separate institutions; their teachers™ quali†cations, sal aries, and training are supposed to be di“erent; their curriculum fra meworks are supposed to be di“e rent. One wonders what makes it a single block.  On  pedagogical grounds, the capabilities of selfrestraint, deal ing with adults and people outside family, concentration span, res ponsible behaviour, selfdirected activities and understanding the value of completing a task widely di“er for a fouryearold and a six yearold. These are the capabili ties which determine the nature of pedagogy and formal learning; not the forming of synapses and the growth of brain mass. Thus, the people developing NCFs have to deal with these is sues in addition to †nding a meth od of making proper sense of gath ered public opinion. If the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) is purely guided by the NEP 2020, we are unlikely to  ensure the sound development of our school children. Fortunately, there is a way through which the teams de veloping the NCF and the SCFs can mitigate Š if not completely solve Šthe problems created by the NEP 2020 as well as take on board pu blic opinion in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, such a fra mework can also help in making appropriate use of what is good in this policy, for it is not completely devoid of good recommendations. For example, ‘exibility in secon dary education, examination re form, more exposure to Indian languages, and taking on board In dian knowledge systems can make our education system better. Documents of value One way out of this problem is to take a lot of help from the Secon dary Education Commission Re port (SECR) and Zakir Hussain™s Basic National Education (BNE) re port. The purpose of surveys on public opinion is to create a con sensus on basic values, and the vi sion and the direction our educa tion system should take. The SERC assumes, without saying,  that the democratic polity we adopted gives us that consensus. They also collected a lot of data, but that da ta was analysed and organised in the light of the vision of the indivi dual, society, and education inhe rent in the democratic ideal. Thus, they had all the three necessary elements: the overall framework of values and future direction, cur rent issues and problems of the education system, and public opi nion. The SECR makes sense of the latter two in the light of the earlier. And it rigorously works out the aims of education, pedagogy and content to achieve those aims. The logical rigor is very clear in work ing our aims from the democratic values and pedagogy from the aims. It is somewhat loose in work ing out the content. But the direc tion is clear. Another useful document in this regard is the BNE. The logical ‘ow in this document may be so mewhat amiss at one or two places in the beginning. But the rigorous derivation of educational aims from the vision of society, curricu lar objectives from the aims, and content from the objectives are starkly clear. These are coherent and rigorous documents because they place the values and princi ples of democracy and a morally, aesthetically and intellectually rich individual life at the starting point and try to resolve current economic problems in alignment with them. The current policy re verses the order. It is not that the content from these documents should be borrowed; rather, that the approach they take has much to teach. It is rigorous, rational, and very sound. Interestingly, the †rst edition of the BNE was in 1938 (https:// bit.ly/2V2I9ij) , SECR was written in the 1950s. Patricia White, a Brit ish philosopher of education, †rst argued for making democracy the basis for working out the school curriculum in 1973. John White worked out a rigorous method for the same in a paper published in 1998 . The BNE and the SECR do not philosophically argue or give the detailed exposition of the method; they make practical use of this approach. It is somewhat surprising that the reports and curriculum frameworks deve loped after the 1980s in our coun try are completely overwhelmed by the current problems or by the pedagogical ideals of childcen trism and simply assumed that vague assumptions about the de mocratic ideals mentioned here and there randomly was enough. The  objectives and content in these later documents are based on other fashionable or political or current issues. Placing the debate It is time to again place the demo cratic ideal at the centre of our education. Not as an  object of lip service or reverence, but as the source of a framework of values and principles to judge and justify all other aspects. Otherwise, we are likely to make the curriculum a political football, and stir up de bates that border on cacophony. Let us remember that opinions without supporting arguments are nothing more than assertions. And one citizen™s assertions are only as good as another™s. This leaves the conclusion of the debate to the most powerful. The only way to wrest the judgment from the hands of the powerful is to have the curricular debates rooted in democratic values.

Even a participant without any titles, is referred to as an Olym pian and it is an eternal stamp that sportspersons ob sess about. The quadrennial congregation of the world™s †nest athletes is set to begin, after a year™s delay imposed by the pandemic™s shadow. ‚Tokyo 2020™, as the Olympics is branded for the latest edition, will com mence at Japan™s capital on Friday while COVID19 pro tocols are in place. Tokyo and Fukushima will conduct events without spectators while a limited number may be allowed at stadiums in the Miyagi and Shizuoka re gions. Local approval ratings for the Games now stand at the halfway mark, a considerable improvement es pecially after an 83%opposition as recent as May. Hav ing previously hosted the Olympics in 1964, Tokyo™s se cond dalliance with the premier championship has been extremely tough. Even two days ago, there were whispers of cancellation as the coronavirus graph linked to the Games and to Japan revealed an upward climb. Within the Olympics Village ecosystem of ath letes, coaches, o’cials and volunteers, around 70 have tested positive for COVID19. But the Olympics harking back to its Athens roots in 1896, is expected to hold stea dy till its conclusion on August 8.  When it comes to winning at the Olympics, the Unit ed States of America, Russia, China, European nation sand Australia have excelled. India meanwhile has a mere 28 medals to show despite turning up since 1900. India™s initial share came from hockey but even that tap has run dry since the gold at Moscow in 1980. India™s tilts in the Olympics have often been infused with path os. Legendary runners Milkha Singh and P.T. Usha mis sing their bronzes in 1960 and 1984 respectively, stil ltest the tear glands of diehard fans. However, over the years and through diverse sports such as shooting, ten nis, badminton, wrestling, boxing and weightlifting, India has earned a few medals. This time around, the pursuit to better the bestever tally of six, gained at Lon don in 2012, continues. Headlined by P.V. Sindhu and Mary Kom besides the talent in shooting, weightlifting and wrestling, India hopes to push its Olympic enve lope further while the yearning for excellence in hock ey lingers. A sobering truth is that the demographicdi vidend of being the second most populous nation, does not really convert into a better yield in multievent jousts. It is a pointer to the need to improve sport s in frastructure as India at the Olympics remains a work in progress. An Olympic medal o“ers sporting nirvana; even tennis legend Serbian Novak Djokovic is no t im mune to its charm. In search of gold The Olympic Games remain the greatest sporting event for fans and athletes alike The cooperative movement certainly needs reform and revitalisation. Beset by political interference, many cooperative societies do not hold elections regularly, while some are superseded frequently. The 97th Constitution Amendment,which came into e“ect in 2012, was a major step towards infusing autonomy, democratic functioning and professional management. The recent Supreme Court verdict holding the amend ment unconstitutional to the extent it applied to coop erative societies under the control of the States is  a  re minder that even wellintentioned e“orts towards reforms cannot be at the cost of the quasifederal prin ciples underlying the Constitution. The amendment ad ded Part IXB to the Constitution, concerning coopera tive societies. Part IXB delineated the contours of what State legislation on cooperative societies ought to  con tain, including provisions on the maximum number of directors in each society, reservation for seats for  SCs ,or STs, and women, besides the duration of the terms of elected members, among others. The question before the C ourt was whether the 97th Amendment impacted the legislative domain of the State Legislatures and, the refore, required rati†cation by half the legislature s, in addition to the required twothirds majority in Parl ia ment. The Gujarat  High Court had found the amend ment invalid for want of such rati†cation. The Supreme Court, by a 2:1 majority, upheld the judgment holdin gthe amendment invalid, but only in relation to cooper atives under the States. The elaborate amendment would hold good for multiState cooperative societie s, on which Parliament was competent to enact laws. Asigni†cant limitation on Parliament™s amending power is the requirement that certain kinds of amend ments to the Constitution must be rati†ed by 50% of the State legislatures. The Union government believed that as the subject of ‚cooperative societies™ in the State List was not altered in any way by the 97th Amendment, and that it only outlined guidelines on any law on coop eratives that the  Assemblies may enact, the rati†cation was not necessary. A key principle from the judgment is that the rati†cation requirement will apply if there is any attempt to fetter the State legislatures in any way while enacting a law in their own domain, even if there is no attempt to alter the distribution of legislative pow ers between the Union and  States . Thus, in the absence of rati†cation by the States, the amendment that sought to prescribe the outlines of State laws on a State subject did not pass constitutional muster. The judgment may mean that the concern expressed by some about the ad verse implications of the formation of a new Ministry of Cooperation on federal principles could be true. Ho wever, there is no denying that the scope for democra tising the functioning of cooperative societies and  en hancing their autonomy remains unchanged. Limits of cooperation Reforms in cooperative sector should  not be at the cost of federal principles This PDF was originally uploaded To The  English Newspaper L Banna SA (https://t.me/English_Newspaper_L_Banna)one else Backup chennal @NEWS_Backup_L_Banna

THE HINDU VISAKHAPATNAM
FRIDAY,JULY23,2021 7OPEDLahore, July 22: Three persons were arrest ed yesterday on a charge of rioting under Section 147 I.P.C. outside the Lohari Gate in connection with picketting a liquor shop. It is stated that one of them has been released on bail, the other two being still in custody. In this connection the senior Superinten dent of Police, Lahore, has issued the follow ing letter to the General Secretary, the City Congress Committee, and several other per sons at Lahore:  Sir, it has been brought to my notice that during the past ten days pro cessions joined or accompanied by the lead ing members of the City Congress Commit tee including yourself have been marching from Anarkali to the city and thence through important streets in the city to the accompa niment of songs and recitation and that these processions have attracted crowds of persons numbering two to three hundred, thereby causing obstruction to tra†c. It has further been brought to my notice that the members of these processions have been threatening and improperly interfering with certain shopkeepers and persons visiting their shops. I am therefore authorised by the Additional District Magistrate to draw your attention to the provisions of Sections 30 and 32 of Act 5 of 1861 and to the necessity thereunder of applying for a license in fu ture if you desire to take processions through the city or through the municipal li mits.AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 23, 1921 Lahore antiliquor campaign CC CCDATA POINT  The COVID19 pandemic has caused the biggest disruption to  lives since the Partition in 1947 for those in In dia. It has caused dramatic shifts in our personal and work lives. It has, of course, caused illness and  taken away many of our loved ones. It has caused many people to lose a sub stantial portion of their incomes. It has posed new behavioural challeng es to governments and individuals . It has created great uncertainty. In short, the pandemic has put us all under immense stress. It has been so stressful that the one thing that every person on the planet wants right now is for the pandemic  to end and for life to go back to preCOVID19 days. Chronic anxiety The stress caused by the pandemic has sustained over a long period of time and can be categorised as chronic stress. When we face stress, the body releases a hormone called cortisol. Prolonged exposure to corti sol, the body™s primary stress hor mone, increases the risk of heart dis ease, sleep disruptions and mood disorders like anxiety and depres sion. Chronic stress has been found to kill brain cells and even reduce the size of the brain. Chronic stress has a shrinking e“ect on the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsi ble for memory and learning. Studies in behavioural science show that we don™t tend make good decisions under stress. In fact, they have repeatedly shown that we often don™t make good decisions even in normal times. For example, we know exercising is good for our health but we don™t do it enough. We know ove reating is bad for us but we still in dulge in it often. We know binging on social media takes away time from doing what we are supposed to be doing but we can™t stop scrolling. This is some of our behaviour in nor mal times. Given that we are now fac ing chronic stress, our behaviour is becoming more irrational. For exam ple, outdoors is generally a safer place to meet people than indoors because of a greater degree of venti lation. Yet, people feel safer indoors than outdoors. Indoors are generally safer than outdoors at protecting us, but not during the pandemic. People are more likely to wear masks out doors, where it is actually safer, and remove their masks indoors, which at a time like this is risky behaviour.  After the ‘rst COVID19 wave de clined in India, people began travell ing, holidaying, partying and attend ing weddings. There was no availability of vaccines then.  When people had little  protection against COVID19, they behaved fearlessly. But now, even after partial or full  vac cination, people seem more scared of contracting COVID19 than they were after the ‘rst wave. Studies around the world are showing that most vaccines are demonstrating more than 90% protection against hospitalisation due to COVID19. One would think that should make people less fearful, but that™s not the case. Mindless investing While most people are facing a drop in income, those with disposable in comes have begun investing their money on their own. Brokerage ‘rms in India have reported the highest number of demat account openings in the past 15 years. Driven by the fear of missing out, a large number of newbie investors have begun follow ing their herd by investing money in India™s stock markets and even in cryptocurrencies. But history shows that retail investors, especially the in experienced newbies, are the last to enter bull runs, buyingstocks and as sets at high prices, because people in their social network are making mo ney. People love making easy money. History shows that such irrational in vesting leads to bubbles that even tually burst leaving such investors with massive losses. People have be gun buying and selling cryptocurren cies. These are not currencies but mere speculative instruments be cause they are neither backed by any underlying asset nor by the govern ment. In fact, ‚crypto™ means hidden or secret. But history shows it™s no se cret that such speculative manias are caused by our own irrational beha viour. The COVID19 pandemic has made it more di†cult for us to think rationally. Anand Damani is behavioural scientist and partner at Briefcase Making decisions under stress The pandemic has made it more di†cult for us  to think rationally Anand Damani The deposed Sudanese Leader, Major Gen. Gafaar Numeiry, was back in power in Khar toum today [Cairo, July 22] after a counter coup, U.A.R™s news agency reported quoting Omdurman (Sudanese) radio. On Monday, an army junta staged a coup and had seized power, overthrowing Numeiry. The agency said a detachment of troops under Lieut. Mohammed Kabawi occupied the broadcast ing station and had returned Maj. Gen. Nu meiry to power. Omdurman Radio said that President Numeiry™s men were now in con trol of the Sudanese broadcasting building. The radio said President Numeiry ﬁwould continue to lead the nation.ﬂ Omdurman Ra dio said that the successful countercoup was led by Lieut. Mohamed Aly Karbass. ﬁThe ordeal of the Sudan during the past two days is over,ﬂ an announcement over the radio said. Maj. Gen. Numeiry, it said, is in ﬁgood health and remains the man who is leading and will continue to lead the nation.ﬂ FIFTY YEARS AGO  JULY 23, 1971 Numeiry back in power in Sudan CC CCFROM THE ARCHIVES In June, the Union Ministry of Con sumer A†airs, Food and Public Dis tribution came out with a list of pro posed amendments to  the Consumer Protection Act of 2019. These include appointment of a Chief Compliance O“cer and a Re sident Grievance O“cer, provisions of fallback liability, registration of ecommerce entities and a ban on ‘ash sales. The Centre claims that these amendments try to rein in un fair trade practices adopted by e commerce companies and intend to take care of the interests of consum ers. But not everyone agrees.  Anu pam Manur and  Prithwiraj Muk herjee discuss the proposed amendments in a conversation moderated by  Prashanth Peru mal J .Edited excerpts: What is your view on the draft ecommerce rules? Do they favour the consumers as the government claims? Anupam Manur: I™m critical of these new set of rules on multiple accounts. The ‘rst is the sheer scope of the law. The rules are ap plicable to all goods and services bought or sold over a digital or elec tronic network. When we say ﬁall goods and servicesﬂ, it includes your food delivery apps, hotel book ing websites, etc. So, basically any kind of ecommerce. That™s a large move to be coming from the Minis try of Consumer A“airs, which brings me to my second point about overlapping jurisdictions. There™s a lot of talk about dominant ‘rms. The regulation of these ‘rms should actually come within the  ambit of the Competition Commission of In dia. Then there™s talk about data pri vacy, which again is an issue which should be addressed by a data pro tection law.  I think the rules are lar gely trying to push the govern ment™s ‚Make in India™ initiative and favour small and medium scale en terprises, all under the veil of con sumer protection.  Prithwiraj Mukherjee:  The draft is very complicated and the intent of the new rules is not clear . I™m as suming that the intent is  to prevent one or two dominant ‘rms from tak ing over not just ecommerce but commerce in general. But it™s one thing to have a law and another thing to uphold that law. I™ll give you an example from a slightly di“erent domain. For a long time, we have what is known as a ‚Do Not Disturb™ list in our mobile phone sector. And most of us are probably registered on that list. Has that stopped you from getting spam? In fact, my ser vice provider is sending me spam from  scammers. And I am reasona bly certain that these people are do ing it through the service provider and that they didn™t get my number through any other way. If we were to bring this into ecommerce, the question is whether the same thing is going to happen with the new draft rules. I don™t know. So, how you uphold a legislation is just as im portant as the legislation itself.  Don™t you think putting the rules down on paper gives power to government o†cials to go after companies that break the rules?  PM: In principle the draft rules seem okay. There might be hidden consequences that we™ll discover only with time.  AM: Even in principle, the draft rules are unnecessary. Ecommerce platforms already have customer care centres where you can lodge complaints. There is competition between platforms. Beyond that, there are a lot of other quality checks that these marketplaces put in place. There are  consumer courts that cheated customers can access. I don™t think you need a separate no dal o†cer or a grievance o†cer .That just adds to the bureaucracy. Anyway, there™s not enough state capacity for implementing some of these rules. If you start a law know ing that you can™t implement it, I think it™s bound to fail .Among other things, the draft asks companies to favour domestic goods over foreign ones. Do you smell any protectionism in the new rules?  PM:You™re using protectionism as a bad word. Every country has its own form of protectionism. In fact, the moment you charge an import duty, it means you are  implicitly protecting your own people against some other country™s imports. That said, what we know is that a big company will always ‘nd a way to subvert  a few laws. Let me give you the example of a ban on tobacco ad vertising. Did that stop India™s lar gest tobacco company from spon soring a World Cup or the Indian cricket team? No, the company just found another way. At the end of the day, I think it is about ticking boxes. The spirit of the rule will never be implemented. What will happen is that companies will ‘nd increasing ly creative ways of subverting the letter of the law.  AM: The fact that they™re asked to provide a domestic alternative at the same time... I think that™s not a level playing ‘eld. I don™t see any kind of economic reasoning for why an ecommerce marketplace has to push for a domestic alternative. If the domestic alternative is really that good, that company can com pete. People will choose based on the quality of the products, price, etc. So, I will say that this is protec tionism. To me, marketplaces being asked to provide domestic alterna tives reeks of protectionism.  Could there be unintended consequences due to provisions such as the ban on “ash sales, fallback liabilities, etc.?  AM: I don™t even see how the ban on ’ash sales is supposed to help consumers. You would think that ’ash sales help consumers . Second ,the wording of the provision is just so wrong. They™ve said things like ﬁsigni‘cant reduction in priceﬂ. What do you mean by a ﬁsigni‘cant reduction in priceﬂ? Is a 20% dis count signi‘cant for an iPhone? The rule is just open to di“erent inter pretations. But, as Prithwik said, these big companies are experts at regulatory arbitrage. They will ‘nd away to negotiate and navigate through these things. It will be the smaller sellers and  ecommerce platforms that will not be able to na vigate through these laws. So, what you™re doing, in fact, is the opposite of what you wanted to achieve, which is to help out your small sell ers. The draft rules are just going to increase costs for ecommerce.  Regarding fallback liability, again it makes no economic sense. It dis plays a brazen misunderstanding of what marketplaces are supposed to be. It™s like holding a kirana store lia ble for selling you washing powder that is defective . That™s not how marketplaces work. PM:I agree with Anupam on the is sue of ’ash sales. I think it™s a terri ble idea for the brand: it devalues your brand but that should not be the regulator™s concern. But I will say something about deep discount ing. Now, the draft does not really specify what exactly constitutes a deep discount. But let™s go a little bit into the history and understand why they may have done this.  In the U.S.,  there are some big players with big pockets who did what is known as loss leader pricing.  Walmart, for example, would go into a small town in the U.S. and set up business. It would then o“er expensive pro ducts such as medicines for free. This caused small pharmacies that cannot match Walmart to go out of business. If you look at the Ameri can retail space, the smalltime re tailers essentially went out of busi ness.  France realised that deep dis counting can create problems. So, what it mandated is that you cannot sell anything cheaper than the price you bought it for. So, you have to ac tually talk about your procurement price. And there are only two ap proved sales seasons a year when stores can get rid of excess invento ry by selling at lower than the  cost price. The idea is to prevent a Wal martlike situation. So, in principle, Iam not against having a law against deep discounting.  AM:I think retail density in India is amazing compared to many  coun tries in the world. So, again, this comes back to the question of ne cessity. Do we need this law in this fashion at this moment? The answer is no. You have to do a costbene‘t analysis comparing the harm that the rules can potentially cause ver sus the potential bene‘ts. I think the harm is higher at this point. There is alot of competition among ecom merce retailers. So, I don™t see a need for this law just yet. I don™t think it is forwardlooking either.  What do you see as the real reason behind these rules?  AM:I think we™ll be going into spec ulative territory, which is slightly unsafe. But in most people™s read ing, it is just to help consumers. But if you look at the overall policy ap proach taken by this government over the last few years, that tells me that the government wants to en courage ‚Make in India™ because that™s one of its  ’agship schemes. They are trying to do this through rules without realising the kind of harm they can do in the long run, even for the domestic Indian ‘rms. Aseries of steps in di“erent do mains Š from increasing import ta ri“s on various products to encou raging domestic manufacturing Š tell me that they want promote domestic industries. PM:It is  di†cult to impute motives. But even if you were to impute mo tives, I don™t think vote bank politics is relevant here. I don™t think anybo dy™s going to vote based on these rules. Could there be lobbyists? Yes. But I am not willing to speculate.  What kind of rules would actually protect consumers?  PM:  There are two principles. One is that consumers should not be cheated. So, any law that deals with deceptive advertising, leaking of da ta, spamming, etc. is in principle de sirable. The second is that the mo nopolist should be properly regulated. Even the most capitalist economies will take action against monopolies. The other thing is you have a large number of gig workers in the ecommerce sector. Their needs need to be addressed.  AM: Before any form of govern ment intervention, I would ask what is the market failure that you™re try ing to address. Concentration of market power is a genuine concern that requires some form of interven tion, but not through consumer pro tection tools. You have an entire bo dy dedicated to doing this, which is called the Competition Commission of India. The second kind of market failure could be information asymmetry. But remember the whole point of the ecommerce marketplace is to reduce informa tion asymmetry as well. Consumers can compare di“erent products, rate and review products, etc. If you need to do something more, you can set quality standards. Beyond that, people who have been cheated have a consumer court. If you look at our standard shopping expe rience, sometimes you can buy things which are substandard. You either live with it and learn from the experience and buy better next time or if you™re deeply hurt and it™s a really expensive buy, you move the court. Consumers already had these options available to them. There™s no reason why a lot of the consumer protection rules that the govern ment has come up with for the e commerce retailers should not ap ply to brickandmortar stores. The fact that they™re going after ecom merce alone should tell you that their entire motive is di“erent. Will the new ecommerce rules really favour consumers? The intent of the rules is unclear and there are several consumer protection rules already in place  Prithwiraj Mukherjee  is Assistant Professor at IIM, BangaloreAnupam Manur is Assistant Professor at the Takshashila InstitutionScan the QR code to listen to the full interview online PARLEYREUTERS <>The rules are largely trying to push the government™s ‚Make in India™ initiative and favour small and medium scale enterprises, all under the veil of consumer protection.Anupam Manur This PDF was originally uploaded To The  English Newspaper L Banna SA (https://t.me/English_Newspaper_L_Banna)one else Backup chennal @NEWS_Backup_L_Banna
