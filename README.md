There are many instances of children being left to the care of a single parent, with the sole breadwinner suc- cumbing to the virus.  To reach out to such chil- dren, District Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal has directed Samagra Siksha Additional Project Director J. Vijaya- lakshmi to conduct a de- tailed survey to identify such orphans so as to accommo- date them in the Urban Resi- dential Hostel located in the Cantonment area in Vizia- nagaram.  At present, there are 79 boys in the hostel. It is ex- pected to provide accommo- dation to 200 children in the 2021-22 academic year. The inmates can continue with their studies in the munici- pal schools located nearby.  ﬁThe survey is being taken up in all the 36 mandals. The principals of the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidayalayas (KGBVs) have been advised to share details of the or- phans in a couple of weeks,ﬂ Ms. Vijayalakshmi told  The Hindu.  ﬁThe identi“ed orphaned girls will be given admission in the KGBVs while boys will be accommodated in the Ur- ban Residential Hostel. We will help the students excel in studies, sports and extra- curricular activities. Special training programmes are be- ing conducted for teachers to handle such children,ﬂ Ms. Vijayalakshmi said.  Children of single parents would also be given admis- sion in the hostel, said P.K. Prakasha Rao, Director, Inte- grated Rural People Welfare Association.  ﬁThe hostel is a blessing in disguise for those who have lost their parents due to CO- VID-19. The children of HIV- a‘ected patients, divorced parents, and those below the poverty line will also be ad- mitted. We request the rela- tives of such children to con- tact us immediately,ﬂ said Mr. Prakasha Rao.  Alternative School coordi- nator M. Srinivasa Rao said that the library, playground, tuition facility, and nutri- tious food were some of the facilities available in the hos- tel.  ﬁAs suggested by the Dis- trict Collector, we are ap- pointing three tutors to clari- fy the doubts of the students. The children will be impart- ed education on a par with corporate schools,ﬂ said Mr. Srinivasa Rao.

K. SRINIVASA RAO VIZIANAGARAM The Andhra Pradesh Go- vernment Employees™ Asso- ciation on Friday urged the government to take steps for constituting the Pay Revi- sion Commission (PRC) and reverting to the old pension system since the Contributo- ry Pension Scheme (CPS) failed to ensure social secur- ity for the retired employees. In a press release here, as- sociation district president P. Ramachandra Rao and State secretary L.V. Yugand- har thanked their State pre- sident K.R. Suryanarayana and general secretary G. As- kara Rao for submitting a de- tailed note explaining the 26 grievances to Chief Secre- tary Adityanath Das.  ﬁIn the backdrop of rising in†ation, the government should take steps to consti- tute a PRC for ensuring a de- cent “tment for the sta‘. We request the government to release at least “ve DAs out of seven immediately. The government should take steps for payment of salaries on the “rst day of every month,ﬂ said Mr. Ramachan- dra Rao. ﬁWe also request the government to imple- ment “ve-day week for all the sta‘ . At present, it is be- ing implemented for the Head of the Departments and Secretariat sta‘. The go- vernment should also lift the ban on regular transfers while extending the facility to contract employees also,ﬂ he said. APGEA leader Vinay Mohan urged the govern- ment to put in place a fool- proof system in preparing the seniority list and process the annual con“dential re- ports only through the HoDs. He lauded Mr. Suryan- arayana™s initiative in getting special leave for all the em- ployees and o’cers a‘ected by COVID-19.

People having suicidal tendencies can contact pol- ice helpline No. 100. Woman ‚jumps™ to death with son Staff Reporter VISAKHAPATNAM Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV) has appealed to Chief Minis- ter Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to take advantage of the pre- sent decline in COVID-19 cas- es to initiate measures to ramp up facilities at the CO- VID hospitals in view of the third wave surge expected to begin in the second half of August. In a letter to the Chief Mi- nister on Friday, PAV general secretary T. Kameswara Rao and its president M.V. Rama- naiah said that the second wave had created terror among the people with the death of a large number of patients. The new variants of coronavirus are likely to have a serious impact on pu- blic health, especially on children. They said that adequate precautions and preventive measures in advance will go along way in containing the spread of the virus. Strict ad- herence to the COVID-19 protocols like wearing masks, observing physical distance and frequent hand sanitisation will go a long way in controlling the third wave surge. A wide publicity campaign should be organ- ised once again to sensitise the citizens, they said. Testing should be in- creased further and regular monitoring and treatment should be made available. Adequate number of isola- tion centres should be made available. Isolation centres should be set up at the man- dal level. It is advisable to set up at the panchayat level, if possible. Genome research should be conducted on at least 5% of blood test sam- ples to quickly identify new variants that are rapidly forming. People should be alerted from time to time on new virus variants and their impact. The vaccination programme should be ex- panded and further acceler- ated by increasing the num- ber of vaccination centres. Doctors, paramedical sta‘ and ASHA workers should be appointed on a perma- nent basis, without any delay. The PAV leaders also sought that medical stu- dents should also be given appropriate training and utilised in COVID services. Beds and wards with all facil- ities related to COVID care should be set up in the dis- trict hospitals, Area Hospi- tals, Community Hospitals and Primary Health Centres (PHCs). At least 30 % of all beds in community and area hospi- tals should be made availa- ble for the treatment of chil- dren. Oxygen concentrators must be installed in all the PHCs and steps should be ta- ken to ensure that there is no shortage of PPE kits, masks and sanitisers in all hospi- tals.  Door-to-door survey The other suggestions in- clude continuation of door- to-door survey programme, setting up of a committee of medical experts to formu- late and implement the ‚CO- VID control and contain- ment™ plan and regulating the cost of treatment to pre- vent exploitation of patients by corporate hospitals.

The city police said that out of the to- tal accidents, two-wheeler accidents had a major share. According to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, (Tra“c), Ch Adina- rayana, among the two- wheeler accident cases, mis- takes on part of the driver were seen on many occa- sions. ﬁSince the last two years, a number of aware- ness programmes were or- ganised over use of helmet. This has substantially re- duced the fatalities, as peo- ple have started to wear hel- mets. But in some cases, it has been seen that the fatali- ties have occurred due to not-proper wearing of hel- mets and using poor quality helmets,ﬂ he said. The ADCP said that sever- al motorists died after falling under the wheels or being hit by moving heavy vehi- cles, while trying to overtake them on NH-16. This is an area of concern and moto- rists should be very cautious while overtaking, he said, adding that the city police have been taking steps in controlling speed on the NH-16 in the city limits by ar- ranging speed laser guns. He said that awareness pro- grammes to follow tra“c norms are being organised adding that social media is also being used for this.  During the year 2020, the city had reported 1,146 road accidents in which 259 per- sons died and 1,159 persons were injured. In 2019, as ma- ny as 1,410 accidents were re- ported in which 326 persons died and 1,204 persons were injured. According to the tra“c police, in 2018, the vehicle population was about 10.5 lakh in the city. Every year, there is an in- crease of at least 50,000 veh- icles.  sThe o“cials have been stressing the need for widen- ing the roads, construction of ‘yovers and taking up road re-engineering works at several junctions to ease traf- †c ‘ow. In the recently held dis- trict road safety committee meet under the chairman- ship of Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana, it was decided to identify junctions which witness huge tra“c in peak hours and take up rele- vant steps. According to the o“cials, giving free left to the vehi- cles, construction of service roads and a few other road engineering works are need- ed to be taken at those points as temporary measures. The o“cials have sought re-engi- neering works from Old Ga- juwaka to Kurmannapalem Junction, Yendada, Adaviva- ram to Simhachalam and a few other roads to ease traf- †c congestion in those areas. 171 people died, 670 injured in  accidents in city in †rst half of 2021 Two-wheeler accidents had a major share in them, say police Harish Gilai VISAKHAPATNAM The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) started training pro- gramme for the ward secre- tariat sta’ to conduct a sur- vey for the development of slums in Visakhapatnam ci- ty.

Hari Venkata Kumari said that the main intention of the slum development pro- ject of the State government is to provide all the basic amenities, including roads, drains, community halls, ka- lyana mandapams/commun- ity halls, electricity and drinking water, for the peo- ple living in slums  GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana said that there were 793 slums in the GVMC li- mits.  The secretaries should vi- sit the slums, collect the de- tails regarding population, check whether the people are living in government lands or private lands.
