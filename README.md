THE HINDU THURSDAY,JULY22,2021 6EDITORIALUnder watch The damage caused by Pegasus has farreaching e†ects . The  Indiangovernment, which has not denied so far that any of  itsagencies bought the spyware, has, as usual, rushed to accuse the Opposition parties of bringing up the issue only to denigrate the country in the eyes of the world. It is time the Government gives us honest answers .Tharcius S. Fernando, ChennainThere is so much that we do not know. For example, we do not know who revealed the NSO lists and why. This should be looked into and the Centre must come clean on whether it has either directly acquired, or authorised one of its agencies to acquire thespyware . The Government should also review its bureaucratic digital security measures to avert the misuse of surveillance technology and allay fears of our democracy slipping into authoritarianism. J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad nThe Government in Parliament, and its spokespersons elsewhere, have, as expected, taken to grandstanding, brushing o† the accusation that the Government used the spyware to snoop on citizens. So, let us assume the story is false, it is all celestial and democratic in the State of Denmark, proverbially speaking. But the fact remains that Israeli spyware was indeed used to snoop on select Indianpoliticians, journalists and activists. If the Government is not culpable, then some foreign entity did this and is culpable. Which means that our national security has been compromised and our Government was either unaware, or remained mute or ignorant. Is this not a verygrave situation? The buck stops with the Indian Government.  Anilkumar K., Thiruvananthapuram The Kitex story There are other points in the analysis of the Kitex story using the core tropes of capitalism and globalisation (Editorial page, July 21). One important point is the humiliation and the loss of selfrespect that genuine entrepreneurs have to face from political parties.  Why should hard working vital role in delivering the best results.  J. Eden Alexander, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu nWith the Olympics set to take place in eerie silence  itwill be a test of will for athletes as they will miss the vocal support of  spectators, afactor which helps in their quest for glory. One does understand that the safety of athletes is top priority. We only hope that this does not take away the charm of the sporting spectacle. Zubin Mathew Joseph, Kottayam, Kerala business people have to yield to corrupt elements besides paying taxes? The Kitex story has to help us “nd answers to these practical questions.  P.J. Thomas, Vazhapally, Changanassery, Kerala At the Olympics The point made by Anju Bobby George on the performance of Indian athletes in the Olympics as being more dependent on their psychological framework is apt (‚Sport™ page, July 21).

To read more letters online, scan the QR code Chandrakant Lahariya Those who are either old enough or have read the his tory of health services in In dia, will testify that in the mid1980s, there were a number of government healthcare facili ties across the country, with newly constructed buildings, impeccable linoleum ‘oorings, imported stateoftheart medical equip ment such as infant radiant warm ers and at times ‚foreign made™ cars/jeeps (for the “eld visits of health sta†).  These facilities had bene“ted from generous “nancial and com modity assistance as part of the overseas development assistance (ODA) from many wellintentioned international donors. However, in the year to follow, the number of patients attending these facilities continued to be low and the equip ment remained packed and stacked in store rooms. Years later, the vehicles were repurposed for use in some national programmes such as polio elimination and blindness control. Most of such upgraded facilities had failed to meet the health needs of the poor people. A key reason was that while infrastructure was upgrad ed, there was perennial shortage of health sta†, i.e., doctors, nurses and others, which was supposed to be recruited by the govern ments. Four decades later, in the COVID19 pandemic response, the Indian government appears to re peat the same mistake. Centre™s †nancial package On  July 8, 2021, the Union govern ment announced the  ﬁIndia CO VID19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package: Phase IIﬂ  (https:// bit.ly/3BpyrHl), with the stated purpose to boost health infras tructure and prepare for a possi ble third wave of COVID19. Through this “nancial package, there is plan to increase COVID19 beds, improve the oxygen availa bility and supply, create bu†er stocks of essential medicines; pur chase equipment and strengthen paediatric  beds. However, the package barely has any attention on improving the availability of health human resources.  Even before the novel coronavi rus pandemic, as reported in rural health statistics and the national health pro“le (both o’cial govern ment documents), there are va cancies for  sta† in  government health facilities, which range from 30% to 80%, depending upon the subgroup of medical o’cers, spe cialist doctors to nurses, laborato ry technicians, pharmacists and radiographers,  amongst others. In addition, there are wide inter State variations, with  States that have poor health indicators with the highest vacancies.  Workforce shortage The G overnment seems to have re cognis ed the gaps in health infras tructure; however, the shortage in the health workforce is barely be ing discussed. An intensive care unitbed or ventilator is no use un less there aretrained sta† to run these equipment and quali“ed doctors and nurses to attend to  patients. Sixteen months into the pandemic, though there has been occasional recognition of the shor tage in the  health workforce and a few commitments to “ll the vacan cies; very few are known to fructi fy, even partially, at both the U n ion and State levels. As an example, the Union Ministry of Health in May 2020, announced recruiting 300 epidemiologists; it is not known what the status is. Among the States which an nounced “lling vacancies of health sta†, attention has  mostly been narrow Š on select sub groups such doctors or nurses, and not holistic, and promises remain unful“lled.The COVID19 package II (which focuses on health infrastructure strengthening) needs to be urgent ly supplemented by another plan and a similar “nancial package (with shared Union and S tate go vernment funding) to “ll the exist ing vacancies of health sta† at all levels. Alongside, an objective ap proach to assess the midterm health human resource needs could be the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS), which prescribe the human resources and infras tructure needed to make various types of government health facili ties functional. Oncesuch a need is assessed, the Union and State governments  would have to come up with another “nancial package for human resources to comple ment the COVID19 health package II. That alone can make health fa cilities functional in a sustainable manner. The broader picture Second, the COVID19 pandemic should not be seen in the narrow sense of an infrastructure shortage for the health sector. Even after being supplemented by another package for health human re source, the pandemic should be used as an opportunity to prepare India™s health system for the fu ture. As an initial step in this direc tion, the new Union Minister of Health should consider getting a comprehensive review of actions taken on the key decisions and Go vernment promises made (to strengthen health services) since the start of the pandemic in March 2020. Alongside, the progress on key policy decisions, for the last few years, to strengthen India™s health system, including those in India™s national health policy of 2017, need to be objectively scrutinis ed. These two sets of policy decisions and announcements should be re viewed and progress monitored, through a meeting of the Central Council of Health and Family Wel fare, of which the Health Ministers of the States are members. This should not wait for the pandemic to get over and should be done now. It is only if the past policy promises and commitments are followed through and implement ed thatIndia™s health system could be strengthened from what it is now. India™s health system will not bene“t from adhoc and a patch work of one or other small packag es. It essentially needs some trans formational changes. The COVID19 package  II appears insuf “cient and seems to be based upon a misguided assumption that infrastructure is equal to health services. G overnments (both U n ion and S tate ) seemto be on the path to repeat  four decadeold mistakes. While  international do nors could be excused for being bereft of ground realities, what would  the excuse for the G overn ment be?

India has ‚temporarily™ closed its consulate in Kandahar and evacuated its di plomats and IndoTibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel stationed there. This follows the decision to suspend operations in the Indian consulates in Jalalabad and Herat. As a result, India today is left with its Embassy in Kabul and the con sulate in MazareSharif.  The Taliban™s sway These developments indicate two things: New Delhi™s decision to partially ﬁwithdrawﬂ from Afghan istan shows that betting only on the government in Kabul was a big mistake, and that New Delhi realis es the threat Taliban poses to In dian assets and presence in Af ghanistan. Either way, India™s Afghan policy is at a major cross roads ;  to safeguard its civilian as sets there as well as to stay rele vant in the unfolding ‚great game™ in and around Afghanistan, New Delhi must fundamentally reset its Afghanistan policy. India must, in its own national interest, begin ‚open talks™ with the Taliban before it is too late. The time for hesitant, halfembar rassed backchannel parleys is ov er. However, when I say it is time to ‚openly™ talk to the Taliban, I do not mean according recognition to the Taliban. In any case, what is there to ‚recognise™ at this point as far as the Taliban is concerned? It is only one of the parties in Af ghanistan Š it is neither the Af ghan government, nor a part of it. Not yet. But with over a third of Af ghanistan™s more than 400 dis tricts under Taliban control, the talktotheTalibanoption is in deed the best of the many less than perfect options available to India.  To be fair, New Delhi has been steadily abandoning its puritanical policy towards the Taliban over the past few years. In late 2018, when Moscow organised a confe rence which had the Taliban, members of the Afghan High Peace Council, and other coun tries from the region in atten dance, India sent a ‚nono’cial delegation™ of two retired diplo mats to Moscow. Thereafter, in September last year, India™s Exter nal A†airs Minister S. Jaishankar joined the inaugural session of the intraAfghan negotiations in Doha. Last month, reports indicated that India has started reaching out to the Taliban which was indirectly con“rmed by the Ministry of Ex ternal A†airs when it said ﬁwe are in touch with various stakeholders in pursuance of our longterm commitment towards develop ment and reconstruction in Afghanistanﬂ. However, such halfhearted, halfembarrassed, ideologically hesitant meandering outreach to the Taliban is hardly su’cient to safeguard Indian interests in a ra pidly shifting Afghan geopolitical landscape. Open dialogue with the Taliban should no longer be a ta boo; it is a strategic necessity. The refore, our outreach must now be direct and unambiguous. But be fore I explain why I say so, let me brie‘y analyse New Delhi™s ration ale for the indirect approach to the Taliban.Rationale for indirect talks  There are at least “ve possible rea sons why New Delhi appears to want to keep the Taliban engage ment slow and behind closed doors. For one, if New Delhi chooses to engage the Taliban di rectly, it could make Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani, thus far India™s trusted partner, uneasy. This could potentially nudge him to look towards China and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa tion (SCO) for national security and personal political survival. So, in New Delhi™s calculation, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Two, decision makers in New Delhi are also faced with the dilemma of who to talk to within the Taliban given that it is hardly a monolith. New Delhi may have lit tle access to the members of the Quetta S hura or the “ghters on the ground in Afghanistan. So, the on ly option might be the Dohabased Taliban negotiators or leaders such as  Abdul Salam Zaeef whose beef with Pakistan is well known. Third, given the global opprobri um that Taliban faced in its earlier avatar and the lack of evidence about whether the out“t is a changed lot today, New Delhi might not want to court the Tali ban so soon. More so, there is little clarity about what the Taliban™s real intentions are going forward and what they would do after as cending to power in Kabul. Finally, it would not be totally unreasona ble to consider the possibility of Pakistan acting out against India in Kashmir if India were to establish deeper links with the Taliban.  New Delhi™s rationale is not en tirely erroneous. And yet, there are more compelling reasons why India should engage with the Tali ban more proactively and openly. For one, whether we like it or not, the Taliban, one way or another, is going to be part of the political scheme of things in Afghanistan, and unlike in 1996, a large number of players in the international community are going to recognise/ negotiate/do business with the Ta liban. So, basic statecraft requires that we follow that route as well. Making peace with the fait accom pli is not always a bad thing espe cially in the absence of better alter natives.  The Pakistan factor Two, the Taliban today is looking for regional and global partners for recognition and legitimacy es pecially in the neighbourhood. So the less proactive the Indian en gagement with the Taliban, the stronger PakistanTaliban rela tions would become. Put di†erent ly, and bluntly, letting the Pakista ni deep state exclusively deal with the Taliban is an inherently bad idea.  Third, even though the Taliban is widely considered to be propped up by Pakistan, it would be a mistake to think that the Tali ban will continue to be Pakistan™s servile followers upon gaining power in Kabul. A world lywise and internationallyexposed Tali ban 2.0 would develop its own agency and sovereign claims in cluding perhaps calling into ques tion the legitimacy of the Durand Line separating Pakistan and Af ghanistan, something Pakistan was always concerned about. More so, contrary to what many analysts assume, a Talibandomi nated Afghanistan, next door to its TehreekeTaliban Pakistan infest ed tribal areas, may not really end up becoming a happy space for Pa kistan. In other words, the Taliban would want to hedge their bets on how far to listen to Pakistan. That is precisely when New Delhi should engage the Taliban.  Four, India needs to court all parties in Afghanistan, including the Taliban, if it wants to ensure its security of its civilian assets there. It makes neither strategic nor eco nomic sense to withdraw from Af ghanistan after spending over  $3 billion, something the G overn ment seems to be prepared to do. Withdrawing from Afghanistan now because the Taliban is on the rise (and we do not want to have relations with them) will go on to highlight how weak our strategic resolve is. Five, India™s outreach to the Ta liban should have started years ago before the Talibanhad many suitors as they do today. So, if In dia is not proactive in Afghanistan at least now, late as it is, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and China will emerge as the shapers of Afghanis tan™s political and geopolitical des tiny, which for sure will be detri mental to Indian interests there. Open the congested frontier Finally, and perhaps most impor tantly, opening up the congested northwestern frontier is key to bringing India™s continental grand strategy on an even keel, a process New Delhi has already started. Backchannel talks with Pakistan and a consequent cease“re on the Line of Control, political dialogue with the mainstream Kashmiri lea dership, secret parleys with Tali ban all indicate that New Delhi is opening up its congested north western frontier. Proactive en gagement of the Taliban will pro vide this e†ort with more strategic heft.  Consider this. Except for the strategic foray into the IndoPacif ic, India today is strategically boxed in  the region and it must break out of it. Afghanistan could provide, if not immediately, India with such a way out. In the end, India™s engagement with the Taliban may or may not achieve much, but nonengage ment will de“nitely hurt Indian in terests. In an ideal world, the Tali ban, given its bloody past, should not have been anywhere near go verning Afghanistan, but it is neither an ideal situation nor is the Taliban stoppable from gain ing power in Kabul. So New Delhi must exorcise the demons of IC814 (the December 1999 hijack ing) from its collective memory and engage with the Taliban 2.0 Š there is no need to be secretive or embarrassed about it. And yet, open engagement of the Taliban is neither tolerating nor accepting the condemnable atrocities com mitted by the Taliban.

It i s clear that the volume and duration of monsoonal rain are turning unpredictable, and intermittent torrents, wi th crippling impacts on cities will become more frequent, in‘uenced by a warming climate. Strengthening that theory, three weather stations in Mumbai recorded a staggering level of rainfall in one week from July 13, ranging from 628 mm in Mahalaxmi to 958.5 mm in Santa Cruz, the latter experiencing a peak of 234.9 mm on July 18. The inundation has taken a toll of at least 32 lives, and the majority of victims died in landslides that crushed their  slum houses at Mahul in Chembur. These deaths of despair recur almost every year, soon to be forgotten in fair weather in a city that prides itself on its enterprise and resilience. In the second year of the CO VID19 pandemic, the monsoon malady poses a double jeopardy, adding to the economic misery of the vulner able  who live in hovels in suburban landslideprone lo cations. Such dire conditions stand in contrast to Mah arashtra™s keen desire to keep Mumbai as the country™s preeminent “nancial metropolis. The limitations in its infrastructure to accommodate intense monsoons, and its notorious inability to provide a†ordable inner city housing to the less ašuent and even the middle class ,are making other cities look more attractive. The catastrophic ‘oods in Mumbai and Chennai in 2005 and 2015, respectively, resulted in the emergence of a management plan drawn up by the National Disas ter Management Authority and later, the “rst dedicated storm water drainage manual by the Ministry of Hous ing and Urban A†airs. But such initiatives can do little if States , which have both power and responsibility over city a†airs, do not feel compelled to address the ch al lenges posed by urbanisation. In fact, Mumbai™s inabil ity to manage recurrent ‘oods and the needs of a mas sive slum population was highlighted by a fact“ndin gcommittee appointed by the Maharashtra government after the 2005 deluge, with calls to liberate the city™s riv ers and lakes from various impediments, enable peren nial ‘ow in the Mithi river, create fresh holding lakes for excess waters, and rehabilitate those who live in ri sky locations. There is a need to clear the air on the follow up to these and other expert recommendations, which the State  can do through a white paper. Mumbai™s ne glect is not unique, though, and most big cities are amorphously expanding to the suburbs where basic in frastructure including drainage is absent, and lakes and rivers are heavily encroached, often with political sup port. Such unplanned growth, with no defences against weather disasters, is leaving cities a lot poorer. Water as woe Mumbai cannot manage its †ooding  without a new deal for drainage and housing Atouchy topic for the Centre and States has been the counting of the dead from COVID19. In 2020, as the pandemic ravaged  Europe and the U.S ., Health M inistry o’cials would incessantly argue that India had better managed the pandemic because its deaths per million of population were comparatively lower . While factually true, it was always apparent that the argument was specious given the size, demographic di†erence and India™s per capita access to quality health care. But the ferocious second wave, in April andMay, characterised by the very visible scenario of hospi tals being overrun, and the sick gasping for a very basic necessity of medical oxygen, revealed a spike in excess deaths, compared to the normal death rate in previous years. Even though independent databases, such as the CRSand State records, show large spikes in deaths, with no other explicable cause other than COVID19, the Centre continues to be in denial of the mortal scale  of the pandemic. Tuesday™s statement by Bharati Pravin Pawar, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, in the Rajya Sabha, that there were no ﬁspeci“c re portsﬂ of deaths from States due to lack of oxygen, led Congress leader K.C. Venugopal, to say the party will move a privilege motion against her .Indeed, it is the absolute lack of empathy or acknow ledgement of the lived experience of many who have watched their closest su†er and die for want of  medical oxygen that makes the Minister™s statement appalling. It is technically true that while no death certi“cate or medical record would note a COVID19 patient™s demise as due to ﬁlack of oxygenﬂ, and therefore not causative, the very fact that the Centre moved in AprilMay to re purpose all its industrial oxygen capacity into prod uc ing and transporting medical grade oxygen is itself evi dence that the inability to access it must be considered as a probable cause of death. In the early days of the pandemic, a COVIDpositive test was necessary to count as a COVID19 death until the ICMR said it was no talways required. Itis bewildering why India Š  with the third highest number of COVID19 deaths globally, whose oxygen crisis was international news, and mor tality “gures considered an undercount Š sees value in denying oxygenshortage casualties. Counterproduc tively, it diminishes public faith in the healthcar e sys tem. India™s leadership sought to convey the impression that the country  had conquered the pandemic and Š chastened by the second wave Š is now advising abun dant caution, with the public messaging focused on the possibility of athird wave, and how nearly a third of the population continues  to be vulnerable as per the ICMR™s fourth serology survey. But diminishing the tra gedy, especially in Parliament and in its o’cial records, only further erodes the G overnment™s credibility.  Dealing with denial India must not play down the COVID19 tragedy, as that would hurt public con“dence This PDF was originally uploaded To The  English Newspaper L Banna SA (https://t.me/English_Newspaper_L_Banna)one else Backup chennal @NEWS_Backup_L_Banna

OINT  CMYKMVZVZE THE HINDU VISAKHAPATNAM
THURSDAY,JULY22,2021 7OPEDﬁSati Anusayaﬂ exhibited at the Wellington Cinema has been attracting thousands of spectators everyday. The Puranic character of the †lm coupled with the great moral con tained in the story has been the chief cause for the collection of such a vast multitude of the shows. The enterprising proprietors of the cinema have spared no pains to secure as wide an advertisement as possible for their exhibition and Washington lantern ad vertisements are to be seen in all the main thouroughfares of the city. It is proposed, we are told, to exhibit the same †lm next week also to satisfy the growing public demand. For the convenience of the mofussil visitors, women and children, the show at 330 P.M. will also be continued. The †lm possesses great educative value and as such deserves great encouragement. AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 22, 1921 Wellington Cinema The justconcluded initial public of fering (IPO) of Zomato, which has successfully raised about “9,000 crore at an astronomical valuation of “66,000 crore, makes one believe that money does grow on trees.  More than 150 years ago, Leo Tol stoy, one of the greatest novelists and thinkers of the world, writing in his book,  What Then Must We Do,  won dered and asked: if everything of va lue and substance is produced in the rural areas, why then are the villages mired in poverty and cities  awash in wealth? That question continues to befuddle us.  An old conundrum All these thoughts brought back me mories of my own life from the 1980s. Those days I struggled as a farmer to make ends meet. I toiled  allday, living out of a secondhand Ar my tent in a remote part of rural Kar nataka. One day, after harvesting the banana crop and loading it on to my tractor well before dawn, I drove it to the weekly farmers™ market in Has san, the district headquarters. As I approached the main road leading to the market, my tractor stopped be hind a massive row of trucks and veh icles, hundreds of them, all belong ing to other farmers. Walking up a kilometre I came across thousands of agitated farmers. They had unloaded their fresh green chillies and toma toes on to the road and the black tar mac had turned red and green. The heady pungent fumes from the crushed chillies made it impossible to breathe. Discovering that the pric es had crashed, the farmers were up in arms as they were not even able to recover the transportation costs. So, they had blocked the roads.  Around noon, †nally extricating myself from the melee, unable to sell my produce and crestfallen, I ferried the bananas back to my farm and fed them to my cattle. The  IPO event of Zomato also  re minded me of those days when banks repeatedly turned down my request for an agriculture loan of  “1 lakh but two decades later, a bank sanctioned an eyepopping amount of “500  crore on a silver platter to my lowcost airline as the airline was pu blicly listed and a highly valued stock. The value lay in the mind™s eye of the beholder, who, unbeknownst to me, was in thrall to mythic bears and bulls who swayed the bourses.  All these strange phenomena of the modern economy hark back to the old conundrum: how is it that those farmers who own land, toil and till; produce real stu‘ that we eat and drink and touch and feel; produce things that keep us fed and warm Š grains, fruits, vegetables, meat, cot ton, wool and silk and so on Š live in destitution whereas the merchant who peddles them or the broker who speculates is rich? The multinational behemoths which retail groceries and other products (Kraft  Heinz, Car gill, Tyson Foods, Danone, Nestle, Unilever, Walmart, Reliance), those which build solid steel plants, auto mobiles, buildings, bridges, ships, railways and chains of hotels may in turn wonder why they do all the hea vy lifting but are overshadowed in their stock market valuation by  Amazon, Microsoft, TCS and Infosys. And now, the new kids on the block Š By ju™s, Zomato, and Paytm Š are more valuable than those that have been working for decades. The Manipal Group, for instance,  runs scores of medical and engineering colleges and hospitals. It owns hundreds of acres of prime land across cities in India and even overseas. It has  mas sive education complexes and im pressive  laboratories, medical diag nostics equipment, and surgical operation theatres. Despite  thou sands of crores of investments and hundreds of professors and doctors and nurses, it is valued at a fraction of Byju™s.  Similarly, the Taj Hotels,  Oberoi Hotels and other †vestar hotels own the most expensive real estate. They have luxurious rooms and suites, gourmet restaurants, spas and sa lons, and swimming pools †t for maharajahs. But they are valued less than a fraction of Zomato. And Zo mato, which produces nothing and only purveys the food made by in numerable restaurants across the country, has almost twice the valua tion of Jubilant FoodWorks that owns Domino™s Pizza. While others make pro†ts, Zomato and the new un icorns all bleed cash but have dizzy ing valuations. Imet Neeraj Gupta of Meru Cabs, who was the †rst entrepreneur to launch nationwide GPSlinked radio taxis in India. He  revolutionised ur ban mobility a few years ago. He owned more than 3,000 cars then. His company now has a ’eet of 9,000  cars. But Uber and Ola, which manage a few lakh taxis across the metros of India, have upended his business model. These are assetlight companies that only manage the tax is enlisted on their Internet platform. They meet the needs of customers with optimal,  e‘ective and timely use of available resources but have heady market caps. I am not discred iting these Internet companies. These are indeed brilliant concepts. Agood life Information and data are said to be the new fuel of the modern econo my. The Internet makes the world go round and round and the stock val uations of newage companies can orbit you into space.  But there is limited space in that stratosphere. This world, and life on it, cannot be circumscribed in a makebelieve cloud. You can™t eat in formation and everyone cannot live in the Internet bubble. We need food, clothing, water, housing, tran sportation, electricity and hospitals, and also ’owers, poetry and art. We need education in schools and un iversity campuses where there are teachers in ’esh and blood and where breezy, invigorating dialogue, debate, bonhomie, music, and laughter reign. We need restaurants and travel, and beaches with sun, sand, and wine and kisses. We need stout hearty men and women who work with their hands to provide for the world. All that makes for a good life. That may not make you a billio naire, which the sterile world of the Internet economy can make you, but don™t be disheartened or discour aged. That real world rooted in the earth and soil I speak of can create wealth too. It can give abundant joy and meaning if you do your job with passion and commitment.  Then my thoughts turned to my wife™s 25yearold Iyengar Bakery tucked away in Malleswaram, Benga luru. It is a landmark eatery, which is loved and patronised by the local re sidents. It is part of the cultural land scape. Her wealth has not soared like the stocks of Internet companies. But she is happy and content and loves making breads and buns every day. And she is the master of her own universe. There are countless such people across India in myriad †elds Š farm ers, teachers, doctors, writers, jour nalists, masons, carpenters, black smiths, mechanics, artists, artisans, grocers and vendors Š who serve their communities and provide jobs, livelihoods and security. They make this a wonderful world. Man cannot live by the Internet alone.  Captain G.R.

Gopinath Farmers walk through a newly planted paddy †eld in Guwahati.  RITU RAJKONWAR Father Stan Swamy™s recent death while waiting for bail has prompted an outcry among lawyers, activists and concerned citi zens. While those who admired him were processing their grief, the same National In vestigation Agency (NIA) Court rejected bail for one of his coaccused, Anand Teltumbde. Father Swamy™s arrest under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention)  Act (UAPA) and the denial of bail to him and  others accused in the BhimaKoregaon case have highlighted issues related to police power, pretrial deten tion, and draconian antiterror legislation. However, the role of prosecutors in perpet uating the dominant attitude towards under trial detention has been largely ignored.  Role of public prosecutors The NIA Court order rejecting Father Swa my™s request for bail stated that the prosecu tor submitted various pieces of evidence to prove a prima facie case against the accused. The prosecutor argued that the court must give precedence to the interest of the com munity/society over the right to liberty even though by this stage, Father Swamy™s need for medical attention was apparent. He had Parkinson™s disease, his hearing was im paired and he had contracted COVID19 . Was an 84yearold man in such a precarious state of health a threat to the community™s interests? Was there any risk of him abscond ing or tampering with evidence if released? The prosecutor™s stand in the case as me chanically presenting the investigating agen cy™s case while zealously demanding pro longed detention of the undertrial throws up vexing questions about the role of public prosecutors in the criminal justice system. Public prosecutors are  in’uentialat every stage of a trial. They decide what o‘ences the accused person should be charged with, whether to seek pretrial custody, and what sentence to ask for. However, public prosec utors, unlike defence counsel, have an ethi cal obligation to seek justice balancing the interests of the victims of crime, society, and those accused of crimes. They represent the public and are not mere mouthpieces for law enforcement agencies.  The Supreme Court in  Sheo Nandan Paswan v. State of Bihar (1986 ) cautioned that even though prosecu tors have a duty to represent the executive for trying the o‘ender, and it is broadly their responsibility  to see that the trial results in conviction, they need not be extremely  concerned about the outcome of the case. They act as ošcers of the court and are obliged to ensure that the accused person is not unfair ly treated. The High Court of Delhi, in  Jiten dra Kumar v. State  (1999),  warned that, ﬁIn performance of his duty he can  prosecute the accused, but he cannot assume the role of a persecutor. It is no part of his duty to se cure conviction at all costs... The Public Pro secutor should act fairly and impartially and must be  conscious of  the rights of the ac cused. He is not only required to conduct prosecution case...  but [also] respect and protect the rights of the accused.ﬂ  The duty of a public prosecutor to not as sume the role of persecutor is vital in trials under special statutes like the UAPA, which water down fair trial guarantees. Undertrial detention becomes a convenient means to punish those accused under the UAPA with out convicting them. Such trials are long drawnout, and the conviction rate is low. In 2019, in 11% of UAPA cases (pending from previous years and †led in 2019 ), the police closed the case because of insušcient evi dence or because the accused was untracea ble. Charge sheets were †led in only 9% of the UAPA cases. The conviction rate for UA PA cases was 29.2% compared to an average conviction rate of 50.4% for crimes commit ted under the Indian Penal Code. Narrative building Public prosecutors also have a role in narra tive building. Since they present the state™s case in criminal trials, they build narratives of criminality and criminalisation. Daniel Richmandescribes them as ﬁadjudicative ga tekeepersﬂ who play a key role in translating criminal ﬁlaw on the booksﬂ to criminal ﬁlaw in action.ﬂ Such narratives are especially per nicious in cases involving alleged terrorist activities and ﬁantinationalsﬂ, where anxie ties about the security of the state already haunt the imagination of those in the crimi nal justice system and ordinary citizens. Thus, public prosecutors who support crimi nal justice reform can be a powerful force for altering the culture of undertrial detention. The responses of the prosecutors and law enforcement agencies re’ect the carceral logic that buttresses undertrial detention .Twothirds of  India™s prison population com prises undertrial prisoners. This re’ects the embedding of this carceral logic in the archi tecture of law enforcement  and manifests in prosecutors demanding prolonged custody of the accused. Reversing course will require areimagination of the objectives of the cri minal justice system and cultural change. Leah Verghese is with DAKSH, a nonpro†t based in Bengaluru Prosecutor, not persecutor The public prosecutor has an ethical obligation to balance the interests of the victims, the accused, and society Leah Verghese For now, the risk has receded that the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said to hold the world™s largest untapped crude reserves, might quit the Organ ization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The end to the UAE™s weekslong impasse with Saudi Arabia, one of the world™s biggest crude exporters, and Russia, a non OPEC state,  was brought about by Sunday™s deal. Under its terms, the UAE™s  demand for an increase in its oil output quotas, in recognition of its higher production capacity, has been conceded. The baselines have also been raised for Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq and Kuwait. The compromise The bloc will now step up crude pro duction by 400,000 barrels a day starting in August. The deal will  ex tend until the end of 2022. The out put boost is in response to rising oil prices in the wake of the rebound in economic activity following the eas ing of lockdown restrictions and in creased COVID19 vaccinations in dif ferent parts of the world. Sunday™s deal has also extended until the end of next year the broad terms of the unprecedented production cuts the bloc enforced in April 2020.  The car tel cut oil production by 9.7 million barrels a day (mbd) as oil demand fell from 100 mbd to 91.1 mbd and  prices plummeted from $70 in January 2020 to around $20 in April. The bloc has since gradually rolled back these steep cuts and hopes to return pro duction to prepandemic levels by the end of 2022. The UAE has played hard ball dur ing the bloc™s attempts to deal with the pandemicinduced price volatili ty. In December, when  OPEC+ tried to ease production cuts, the UAE  in sisted that members who diluted the original output reductions should compensate through even steeper cuts, following its own example. Thus, while the internal rift has been resolved for now, the danger cannot be ruled out of an increasingly eco nomically and politically assertive UAE ’exing its muscle. Any potential break with the bloc would undoubt edly prove far more consequential for the OPEC than the 2019 exit of Qatar. Bilateral relations between the tra ditional allies, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have been especially strained since the UAE  established diplomatic ties with Israel last year and with drew troops from the Saudispear headed war in Yemen the year be fore. A more recent arena of tension is the tari‘s Riyadh has imposed on imports from the sixnation Gulf Cooperation Council.  Saudi Arabia will now exclude from the GCC tari‘ agreement goods made by compa nies with a workforce of less than 25% of locals and industrial products with less than 40% of added value af ter their transformation process. Home to a predominantly migrant population, the move could hit the UAE especially hard. Peak in oil demand The latest OPEC compromise echoes growing recognition of the delicate balance between competing domes tic and global priorities. Foremost is their eagerness to maximise the re turns on their substantial hydrocar bon resources, amid growing specu lation of a peak in oil demand within sight. The OPEC, echoing other as sessments, forecast in 2016 that a strict implementation of the Paris cli mate accord could see the demand for oil peak by 2030, owing to the proliferation of alternative fuels and electric cars. Conversely, its report last year pins hopes on population growth and expansion of the middle class for continued increase in oil de mand. The International Energy Agency (IEA), which in 2016 forecast acontinued rise in oil consumption until the 2040s, has more recently hinted at about 5% rise or fall relative to the demand before the pandemic within a decade. The OPEC™s other concerns are the stabilisation of world oil prices without jeopardising national expenditure programmes, and the diversi†cation of economies in anticipation of the unfolding glo bal energy transition. Unity would be of the essence amid this uncertainty.

Mr. Swaran Singh ad vised restraint on the part of members when Mr. N.G. Goray (P.S.P.), who tabled the not ice along with others, urged the Govern ment to take possession of some areas in East Bengal to rehabilitate the refugees. He appealed to the members not to say anyth ing which might be quoted against India in international forums. India, he said, had no desire to seize any part of Pakistan. While taking note of the fact that Gen. Yahya Khan™s threat had come in the wake of the announcement of the SinoU.S. summit meeting, the External A‘airs Minister re peated that India was ready to defend itself if Pakistan used the successes of freedom †ghters in liberating territory in Bangla Desh as a pretext for attacking India.
