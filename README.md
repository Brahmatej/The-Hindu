As U.S. troops continued their withdrawal, the Taliban said its “ghters had seized two crossings in western Af- ghanistan Š completing an arc of territory from the Ira- nian border to the frontier with China. It now held 85% of the country, a Taliban o‘cial said on Friday, controlling about 250 of Afghanistan's nearly 400 districts Š a claim impossible to independently verify, and disputed by the government. On Friday Taliban spokes- man Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP their “ghters had cap- tured the border town of Is- lam Qala on the Iranian fron- tier and the Torghundi crossing with Turkmenistan. Herat Governor spokes- man Jilani Farhad said on Sa- turday the authorities were deploying fresh troops to re- take Islam Qala post, the big- gest trade crossing between Iran and Afghanistan. ﬁThey will be sent there soon,ﬂ he said.The Afghan government has repeatedly dismissed the Taliban's gains as having lit- tle strategic value, but the seizure of multiple border crossings and the taxes they generate will likely “ll the group™ co†ers with new revenue. In a clear sign “ghting was getting closer to major urban centres, an o‘cial at one hospital in Kandahar Š the country's second-largest city and the birthplace of the Ta- liban Š said on Saturday do- zens of wounded had been admitted in the past 24 hours, including at least 15 service members. With the Taliban having routed much of northern Af- ghanistan in recent weeks, the government holds little more than a constellation of provincial capitals that must largely be reinforced and re- supplied by air. Severe strain  The air force was under sev- ere strain even before the Ta- liban™s lightning o†ensive overwhelmed the govern- ment's northern and west- ern positions, putting furth- er pressure on the country's limited aircraft and pilots. On Thursday, President Joe Biden said the U.S. mili- tary mission would end on August 31.  Afghan comman- dos clashed with the insur- gents this week in a provin- cial capital for the “rst time, with thousands of people ’eeing Qala-i-Naw in north- west Badghis province.  On Friday, the Afghan De- fence Ministry said govern- ment forces had ﬁfull con- trolﬂ of the city, but a local o‘cial said on Saturday the insurgents had attacked again during the night.

As of 2016, total emission of plastics into water bodies was between 9 and 23 million metric tonnes per year. If things continue as they are, this is expected to double by 2025. Plastic pollution, together with environmental triggers can lead to exacerbation of climate change, ocean biodiversity loss, the study speculates.  By the end of June 2021 over 150 million children in 19 countries were either attend- ing virtual classes or had no schooling at all. It has been more than a year since the †rst nationwide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pan- demic in India in March 2020 when schools were closed and online classes came in vogue. Parents, teachers, ad- ministrators, governments and children themselves have raised major concerns over this potentially life-al- tering decision for the school-going children.  The recent second wave of the pandemic has made eve- ryone all the more anxious and apprehensive about the safety and wellbeing of chil- dren. This situation has not only led to the loss of educa- tion but also their social and mental wellbeing with hith- erto unknown long-term consequences.  Lessons learnt Moving beyond the emotion- al conundrum, let us look at what we have learnt over this past year about COVID-19 and its impact on children so as to make a scienti†c ration- ale towards the return of young pupils to the class- rooms and hallways of school buildings. Children get infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus but the overall risk of infection re- mains much lower than that of the adults. Studies suggest that children are half as sus- ceptible to infection as adults mainly due to the biological di“erence of having fewer ACE2 receptors and that too mostly in the upper respira- tory tract. These are the re- ceptors in human cells through which the spike pro- tein of the virus binds to the cells. Although mutations in spike proteins have been identi†ed among the virus variants such as beta and del- ta, it is expected that chil- dren will continue to be less susceptible as long as ACE2 receptors remain the major binding sites for the virus.  It is known that 90% of in- fections among children re- main asymptomatic or mild, and although the few chil- dren with severe disease will need hospital care, only 1-2% require intensive care unit management. Children with underlying health conditions could be at higher risk for severe disease. With a low in- cidence of 12 per 100,000 children, according to the In- dian Academy of Pediatrics, the most life-threatening complication that can occur is called multisystem in‘am- matory syndrome in chil- dren (MIS-C) but most chil- dren have recovered well with few deaths mostly at- tributable to management is- sues.  The last nationwide sero- survey (December 2020-Ja- nuary 2021) reported that the proportion of children 10-17 years old with prior infection was similar to the adults at around 25%. This indicates that children were not at a higher risk of infection than the adults. It has been sug- gested that children had a re- latively higher infection rate during the second wave of the pandemic. However, we did not see any rise in the ov- erall proportion of COVID-19 positive children in the coun- try.  Global studies Globally and in India schools have never been reported as the focal point of any super- spreader event. Data over the past year from several countries where schools were functional at various le- vels clearly show that the rate of COVID-19 transmis- sion among students in schools was much lower than in the community.  These include studies from the U.S. of more than 90,000 students and teach- ers in North Carolina, and ov- er 20,000 students and sta“ from 17 schools in rural Wis- consin. Researchers in Nor- way, Salt Lake City and New York City, U.S. found attack rates ranging from 0.5% to 1.7% in schools suggesting that infected students do not tend to spread the virus at school. Very low secondary attack rates Œ the risk of spread from one infected person to others in a closed duals are in the pipeline and could greatly increase access to testing in school settings. Protocols for contact tracing of infected students or sta“, quarantine, isolation, tem- perature checks and symp- tom screening should be in place.  Younger children seem to be less likely to get sick or transmit the virus than teen- agers and adults. Modelling studies indicate that reopen- ing secondary schools will impact community transmis- sion more than reopening primary schools. These †nd- ings suggest that reopening of primary schools should take precedence over secon- dary schools until the com- munity prevalence becomes relatively low to allow secon- dary schools to reopen. Vac- cination of teachers and oth- er school sta“ should be prioritised. It would not only in- ‘uence transmission inside school premises but overall high vaccination coverage will reduce the COVID-19 burden paving the way to- wards safer schools. As parents, educators, health o’cials and public ad- ministrators now is the time to ask not if our schools should reopen but how and when we can make it hap- pen. The intellectual, social, emotional and mental deve- lopment of our children is at stake.  (Dr. Tarun Bhatnagar is a senior scientist at Chennai™s National Institute of Epide- miology, an ICMR institu- tion.)  setting Œ have been reported from school-based investiga- tions in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Singapore and the U.S. However, attack rates of around 15% were re- ported from Israel when schools reopened in mid- May 2020 and were attribut- ed to poor implementation of mitigation measures. We also need to watch out for the emergence of variants and the in‘uence on trans- mission and detection of the virus in children. The level of community transmission in a district should be the key parameter to guide a graded approach to reopening of schools. For this purpose, a matrix of two indicators Œ the reported number of cases per 100,000 population and the test positivity rate Œ could be helpful to categorise dis- tricts. Pragmatic thresholds for each will need to be de- liberated upon by public health experts. Districts with the lowest case burden as well as positivity rate would be the ideal places for resum- ing in-person classes.  Safe return plan We need to have a safe return plan. This would entail strin- gent adherence to universal masking for sta“ and stu- dents, hand hygiene, physi- cal distancing (more so bet- ween students and sta“ than between the students them- selves) and adequate ventila- tion (keeping doors and win- dows open, use of fans and no air conditioning). Out- door areas may be used as classrooms, when possible. Classroom routines will have to be redesigned to limit stu- dent interaction inside and outside classrooms, such as staggered timetables for dif- ferent classes, fewer classes per day, shorter duration of classes etc. High levels of testing and contact tracing within schools would be crit- ical after reopening of schools.  Children are likely to re- main asymptomatic even when infected, and hence fa- cility for routine testing of students once or twice every week is a must. Although PCR testing is the current norm, antigen tests with high sensitivity and speci†city and authorised for children and asymptomatic indivi- Can schools be reopened during the pandemic?  It is more than a year since the †rst nationwide lockdown to contain COVID-19 in India started in March 2020,  when schools were closed Tarun Bhatnagar <>The recent secondwave of thepandemic has made everyone all the more anxious and apprehensive about the safety and wellbeing of children.Cuba™s State-run corpora- tion, BioFarma, said on Fri- day that its indigenously pro- duced Soberana 2 vaccine was 91.2% e’cacious in phase-3 trials. This follows closely on an announcement that another of its vaccines, Abdala, had reported an e’- cacy of 92.8% in late stage trials. The greater-than-90% e’- cacy puts them in a select league; however, unlike the P†zer-BioNTech and Moder- na vaccines that had report- ed an e’cacy of over 90%, both the Soberana and Ab- dala are three-shot vaccines. Both are subunit vaccines, meaning that a part of the vi- rus †orms the antigen and s hitched on to another con- struct. In Abdala the spike protein of the coronavirus is combined with a chemically manufactured adjuvant, whereas in Soberana 2, the spike protein is chemically linked to the tetanus toxoid, making it a conjugate vac- cine. The design and manu- facturing allows the vaccine to be stored in regular refrig- eration settings of 2Œ8 degree Celsius.Conjugate vaccines The most common conju- gate vaccines are those used for Haemophilus in‘uenza type b and the pneumococ- cal bacteria. However, a un- ique aspect of the Soberana vaccine is that it is by far the only one among coronavirus vaccine candidates that re- lies on the conjugate vaccine technology. Marlene Ramirez Gon- zales, one of the scientists in- volved in the Cuban vaccine development project, in a March letter to the  British Medical Journal explained the rationale: ﬁThe [Carribean] island™s four vaccine candidates against COVID-19 are deve- loped as subunit vaccines, one of the most economical approaches and the type for which Cuba has the greatest know-how and infrastruc- ture. From protein S - the an- tigen or part of the SARS- CoV2 virus that all COVID vaccines target because it in- duces the strongest immune response in humans - Cuban [vaccine] candidates are based only on the part that is involved in contact with the cell™s receptor: the RBD (re- ceptor-binding domain) which is also the one that in- duces the greatest number of neutralising antibodies- ...Cuba had already deve- loped another vaccine with this principle. It is Cheimi- Hib, ‚the †rst of its kind to be approved in Latin America and the second in the world™, against haemophilus in‘uenzae type b, coccoba- cilli responsible for diseases such as meningitis, pneumo- nia and epiglottitis.ﬂ Experts say that while there are no inherent disad- vantages to taking a conju- gate-vaccine approach for coronavirus vaccines, they have generally been used against bacteria and not viruses. The two parts of a conju- gate vaccine are typically connected by chains of poly- saccharides, according to epidemiologist and public health expert, Chandrakant Lahariya, and they generally induce a weaker immune response in young children. ﬁCuba has a long history of vaccine development and has developed certain plat- forms that work to their ad- vantage. So it makes sense for them to adopt this route. There is nothing inherently disadvantageous, though, to this approach,ﬂ he said. E†ective response For an e“ective vaccine res- ponse, not only antibodies but even killer T-cells, or those produced by the im- mune system and capable of destroying infected cells, must be produced. In a pro- tein sub-unit vaccine, the spike protein may be able to elicit a strong antibody res- ponse but when combined with the tetanus toxoid, a ve- ry widely used childhood vaccine and therefore one which the immune system recognises, such a T-cell res- ponse could also be generat- ed and conferring more ef- fective protection, said Shahid Jameel, virologist and Director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University. He added that while there could be ﬁlogisticﬂ concerns with a three-dose vaccine, it wasn™t right to compare e’- cacies of various vaccines as those numbers had di“erent contexts. ﬁEvery vaccine's ef- †cacy results are in compari- son to placebo, and not against another vaccine.... each trial was done di“erently.ﬂ While the e’cacy results of the Cuban vaccines ha- ven™t been published in peer-reviewed journals, that the vaccines have been deve- loped entirely by the public health system and amidst a U.S. trade embargo, are among the reasons why they have evoked interest in sev- eral other Caribbean coun- tries as well as beyond. Global response Iran™s Pasteur Institute has said it will participate in phase-3 clinical trials for Soberana 02, with another 60,000 to be enrolled in Ve- nezuela. Other countries in- cluding Mexico, Jamaica, Vietnam, Pakistan and India have expressed an interest in the Cuban vaccines, as has the African Union (on behalf of all 55 of the African na- tions). Cuba, which exports medical services, has said it will apply di“erent rates for vaccines depending on the importer™s ability to pay.

Astudy published in the journal  Nature Astronomy analysed data collected by Cassini spacecraft from the giant water plumes erupting from Enceladus, one of Saturn™s moons. The study has concluded that these data imply either microbial activity or processes not involving life forms but which are very different from those known to occur on Earth. The study thus holds the tantalising possibility of evidence of microbial life on Enceladus.  SNAPSHOTSThe 2020 Millennium Tech- nology Prize, announced in May, has been awarded to Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman, ﬁfor their development of revolu- tionary DNA sequencing techniques.ﬂ Their work is a perfect blend of science and innovation, and very apt as we have all heard a great deal about genome sequencing in the context of the ongoing pandemic.Emphasis on innovation Awarded by the Republic of Finland, along with top Fin- nish academic institutions and industries, The Millenni- um Prize has a 21st century outlook, with a strong em- phasis on innovation. Past winners include Tim Ber- ners-Lee (for implementing the world-wide web) and Frances Arnold (for her work on directed evolution in a laboratory setting). Three of the eleven awardees so far have subsequently won No- bel prizes. We wait, with bat- ed breath, for Balasubrama- nian and Klenerman!  Shankar Balasubramanian was born in Chennai, and has lived in England for most of his life. After his PhD, he joined the Chemistry Depart- ment, Cambridge University. He teamed up with David Klenerman, recruited by the Department around the same time. The initial aim was to build a microscope that could follow single mo- lecules. Of special interest to him was the molecular ma- chinery that DNA uses to make copies of itself. So- mewhere in their discussions arose the germ of the idea for anew way to read the alpha- bet that make up DNA, and to thereby access the informa- tion stored in them. DNA (or RNA, in some vi- ruses), the genetic material of life forms, is made of four bases (A, T, G and C; with U replacing T in the case of RNA). A chromosome is the duplex of a long linear chain of these Œ and in the DNA se- quence is information Œ the blueprint of life. Life famous- ly can replicate, and DNA re- plicates when an enzyme, DNA polymerase, synthesis- es a complementary strand using an existing DNA strand as the template. Breakthrough idea The breakthrough idea of Ba- lasubramanian and Klener- man was to sequence DNA (or RNA) using this process of strand synthesis. They cle- verly modi†ed their ATGC bases so that each shone with a di“erent colour. When copied, the ﬁcolouredﬂ copy of DNA could be deciphered from the colours alone, using miniature optical and elec- tronic devices.  Avery signi†cant advance in their ﬁNext Generation Se- quencingﬂ (NGS) method lies in the size of DNA that could be sequenced at one go Œ more than a million base pairs can be sequenced, which translates to hundreds of genes or even the whole genome of an organism. This is made possible by simulta- neously sequencing hun- dreds of pieces of DNA at the same time. Many copies of this long DNA ﬁsentenceﬂ are randomly broken up into small pieces, each no more than a few hundred bases long, which are all se- quenced together. The ﬁreadsﬂ are then †tted to- gether, in the manner of a puzzle, to give the †nal sequence. This technology was spun o“ as a commercial entity, Solexa, with the initiative of Balasubramanian and Kle- nerman. This phenomenally successful startup was later acquired by the biotech com- pany Illumina. Falling cost What about the cost of all this sequencing? When the Human Genome Project deli- vered the †rst, near-com- plete sequence of our ge- nome, the cost was estimated to have been 3 bil- lion dollars. As all our chro- mosomes together have 3 bil- lion base pairs, it becomes an easy calculation Œ One dollar per sequenced base. By the year 2020, Next Generation Sequencing technologies had pushed the price for se- quencing your genome down to a thousand dollars Œ when this technology becomes prevalent in India, this sum should become a few thou- sands of rupees!  To think that a coronavi- rus genome has not 3 billion but 30,000 RNA bases Œ not surprisingly, this has result- ed in an explosion of data on the genomes of the novel co- ronavirus and its variants. Health authorities in the Un- ited Kingdom have se- quenced the viral genome of one out of sixteen people who have tested Covid-posi- tive. The popular genomic data sharing site GSAID has over two million submissions of Cov-2 genomic sequences, from 172 countries. NGS has been at the heart of monitor- ing the spread of viral var- iants across the globe, and tracing the source of outbreaks. Shankar Balasubramanian continues to run a †ne labo- ratory, focused on the design of therapeutic molecules that would tune down the uncontrolled expression of certain genes, and so control the damage they cause in conditions such as cancer.

BALASUBRAMANIANDo humans perceive joyful or fearful screams more strongly? Most often, a human scream signals fear of imminent danger. But screaming can also express joy or excitement. For the †rst time, researchers University of Zurich have demonstrated that non-alarming screams are more e’ciently perceived and processed by the brain than their alarming counterparts. The researchers investigated the meaning behind the full spectrum of human scream calls. The results revealed six emotionally distinct types of scream calls indicating pain, anger, fear, pleasure, sadness and joy. They found humans respond to positive screams more quickly and accurately and with higher neural sensitivity than to alarming screams. In the trials, 12 participants were asked to vocalise positive and negative screams that might be elicited by various situations. A di“erent group of individuals rated the emotional nature of the screams, classifying them into categories. The brain activity of participants listening to the screams was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to know how they perceived, recognised, processed and categorised the sounds. They found di“erent brain regions showed much more activity and neural connectivity when hearing non-alarm screams . ﬁIt's highly possible that only humans scream to signal positive emotions like great joy or pleasure. Unlike with alarm calls, positive screams have become increasingly important over time,ﬂ Sascha Frühholz says in a press release.
