north, longitudes68°7' and 97°25' east, and mea- sures about 3,214 km fromn north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km. The total length of the  coastline of the mainland, Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman and Nicobar Islands is 7,5 16.6 km. -  Geographical Background Countries having a common border with India are: Afghanistanand Pakistan to the north-west;China, Bhutan and Nepal to the north; Myanmar to the far east; and Bangladesh to the east. Sri Lanka is sepa- rated from India bya narrowchannel of sea formed by the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar. The coun-try can be divided into six zones mainly north, south, east, west, central and north-east.It has 28 states and eight union territories.2Physical Features The mainland comprisesfour regions, namely, the great mountain zone, plains of the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region and the southern peninsula. The Himalayas comprise three almost parallel ranges interspersed with large plateaus and valleys, some of which, like the Kashmir and Kullu val- leys, are fertile, extensiveand of great scenic beauty. Some of the highest peaks in the world are found in these ranges. The high altitudesallow travel only through a few passes, notably the Jelep La and Nathu La on the main Indo-Tibettrade route through the Chumbi valley, north-eastof Darjeelingand Shipki La in the Satluj valley, north-eastof Kalpa (Kinnaur).

2,400 km with a varying depth of 240 to 320 km. In the east, between India and Myanmar and India and Bangladesh, hill ranges are much lower. Garo, Khasi, Jaintia and Naga Hills, running almost east to west, join the chain to Mizo and Rakhine Hills running north to south. India_2021_AMAZON: E published on AMAZON The plains of the Ganga and the Indus, about 2,400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, are formed by basins of three distinct river systems-the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. They are one of the world's greatest stretches of flat alluvium and also one of the most densely populated areas on the earth. Between the Yamuna at Delhi and the Bay of Bengal, nearly 1,600 km away, there is a drop of only 200 me- tres in elevation. The desert region can be divided into two parts  the 'great desert' and the little desert'. The 'great  desert' extends from the edge of the Rann of Kutch beyond the Luni river northward. The whole of the   Rajasthan-Sind frontier runs through this. The 'little desert' extends from the Luni between Jaisalmer and  Jodhpur up to the northern west. Between the great -. and the little deserts lies a zone of absolutely ster-ile country, consistingof rocky land, cut up by lime-  stone ridges. The PeninsularPlateau is marked off from the plains of the Ganga and the Indus by a mass of mountain and hill ranges varying from 460 to 1,220 metres in height.Prominent among these are the Aravali, Vindhya, Satpura, Maikala and Ajanta. The Peninsula is flanked on the one side by the Eastern Ghats where average elevationis about 6100 metres and on the other by the Western Ghats where it is 21 hrs 31 mins left in book 0%

generally from 915 to 1,220 metres, rising in places to over 2,440 metres. Between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea lies a narrow coastal strip, while between Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal, there is a broader coastal area. The southern point of the plateau is formed by the Nilgiri Hills where the East- ern and the Western Ghats meet. The Cardamom  Hills lying beyond may be regarded as a continuation of the Western Ghats. Geological Structure The Indian sub-continentcan be divided in three regions: (i) Extra peninsular regions (the Himalayas); (ii) Indo-Gangetic plains; and (ii) Peninsularregions. The present configuration of India is attributed to the collision of Indian plate with the Eurasian plate around 4-5 crore years ago. This collision and later subduction of the Indian plate has resulted in the formation of most picturesque mountain chain in the world. Prior to the collision, the area remained under marine conditions fora longduration andwas covered by an ocean known as Tethys. In the south of Himalaya, there is a foreland basin known as Indo-Gangetic plains. These plains are youngest in age, highly fertile in nature and mainly consist of alluvium deposited by the rivers draining from the Himalayas and the peninsular regions. Indi- a_2021 DPD: E published on DPD mobile app The peninsular region is shaped like an inverted triangle and considered a storehouse of economic minerals for India. This region is relatively stable and consists of rock unit of earliest periods dating back as far as 3.8 Ga (~380 crore years).

longing to the Deccan Trap volcanism and younger Quaternary sediments. River Systems The river systems of India can be classified into four groups, namely, (G) Himalayan rivers; (ii) Dec- can rivers; (ii) Coastal rivers; and (iv) Rivers of the inland drainage basin. The Himalayan rivers are formed by melting snow and glaciers and therefore, continuously flow throughout the year. During the monsoon months, the Himalayas receive very heavy rainfall due to which rivers swell and cause frequent floods. The Deccan rivers on the other hand are rain-fed and therefore fluctuate in volume. Many of these are non-perennial. The Coastal streams, especially on the west coast are short in length and have limited catchment areas. Most of them are non-perennial. The streams of inland drainage basin of western Ra-jasthan are few and far apart. Most of them are of an ephemeral character. The main Himalayan river systems are those of the Indus and the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghnasys- tem. The Indus, which is a great river of the world, rises near Mansarovar in Tibet and flows through India and thereafter through Pakistan and finally falls into the Arabian Sea near Karachi. Its important tributaries flowing in Indian teritory are the Sutlej (originating in Tibet), the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum. The Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna is another important system of which the principal sub-basins are those of Bhagirathi and the Alak-nanda, which join at Dev Prayag to form the Ganga. It traverses through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Below Rajmahal Hills, the Bhagi- 21 hrs 29 mins left in book 1%

rathi, which used to be the main course in the past, takes off, while the Padma continues eastward and enters Bangladesh. The Yamuna, the Ramganga, the Ghaghra, the Gandak, the Kosi, the Mahananda and the Sone are the important tributaries of the Ganga. Rivers Chambal and Betwa are the important sub- tributaries, which join the Yamuna before it meets the Ganga. The Padma and the Brahmaputra join at Bangladesh and continue to flow as the Padma Ganga. The Brahmaputra rises in Tibet, where it is known as Tsangpo and runs a long distance till it crosses over into India in Arunachal Pradesh under the name of Dihang. Near Passighat, the Debang and Lohit join the river Brahmaputra and the combined river runs all along the Assam valley. It crosses into Bangladesh downstream of Dhubri. The principal tributaries of Brahmaputra in India are the Subansiri, Jia Bhareli, Dhansiri, Puthi- mari, Pagladiya and the Manas. The Brahmaputra in Bangladesh fed by Teesta, etc. finally falls into the Ganga. The Barak river, the head stream of Meghna, rises in the hills in Manipur. The impor- tant tributaries of the river are Makku, Trang, Tuivai, Jiri, Sonai, Rukni, Katakhal, Dhaleswari, Langachini, Maduva and Jatinga. Barak continues in Bangladesh till the combined Ganga-Brahrmaputra join it near Bhairab Bazar. In the Deccan region, most of the major river sys- tems flowing generally in the east fall into Bay of Bengal. The major east flowing rivers are Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery and Mahanadi. Narmada and Tapti are major west flowing rivers. The Godavari in the Southern Peninsula has the second largest river basin covering 10 per cent of the 21 hrs 28 mins left in book 1%

area of India. Next to it is the Krishna basin in the region and the Mahanadi is another large basin of the region. The basin of the Narmada in the uplands of the Deccan, flowing into the Arabian Sea and of the Cauvery in the south, falling into the Bay of Bengal are about the same size, though with different char- acter and shape. While only handful of such rivers drain into the sea near the delta of east coast, there are as many as 600 such rivers on the west coast, which are compara- tively small. A few rivers in Rajasthan do not drain into the sea. They drain into salt lakes and get lost in sand with no outlet to sea. Besides these, there are the desert rivers which flow for some distance and are lost in the desert. These are Luni, Machhu, Rupen, Saraswati, Banas, Ghaggar andothers. The entire country has been divided into 20 river basins/group of river basins, comprising 12 major basins and eight composite river basins. The 12 major river basins are: (i) Indus; (i) Ganga-Brahma-putra-Meghna; (ii) Godavari; (iv) Krishna; (v) Cau- very: (vi) Mahanadi; (vii) Pennar; (vii) Brahmani- Baitarani; (ix) Sabarmati; (x) Mahi; (xi) Narmada; and (xii) Tapti. Each of these basins has a drainage area exceeding 20,000 sq. km. The eight composite river basins combining suit- ably together all the other remaining medium (drainage area of 2,000 to 20,000 sq. km) and small river systems (drainage area less than 2000 sq. km) for the purpose of planning and management are: (i) Subarnarekha-combining Subarnarekhaand other small rivers between Subarnarekha and Baitarani; (ii) east flowing rivers between Mahanadi and Pen- 21 hrs 27 mins left in book 1%

nar; (ii) east flowingriversbetweenPennarand Kanyakumari; (iv) area of Inland drainage in Ra- jasthan desert; (v) west flowing rivers of Kutch and Saurashtra including Luni; (vi) west flovwing rivers from Tapi to Tadri; (vii) west flowingrivers from Tadri to Kanyakumari;, and (vii) minor rivers drain- ing into Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh. Climate/Seasons The climate of India may be broadly described as tropical monsoon type. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) designates four official seasons: (i) winter, from December to early April. The year's coldest months are December and January, when temperatures average around 10-15 °c (50-59°F) in the northwest; temperatures rise as one proceeds to- wards the equator, peaking around 20-25 °c (68-77 F) in mainland India's south-east; (ii) summer or pre-monsoon season, lasting from April to June (April to July in north-western India). In western and southern regions, the hottest month is April; for northern regions, May is the hottest month. Temper- atures average around 32-40 °C (90-104 °F) in most of the interior; (Gii) monsoon or rainy season, lasting from June to September. The season is dominated by the humid south-west summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from north India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall; and (iv) post-monsoon season, lasting from October to December. In north-western India, October and November are usually cloudless. 21 hrs 26 mins left in book 1%

The Himalayan states, being more temperate, ex- perience two additional seasons: autumn and spring. Traditionally, Indians note six seasons, each about two months long: spring, summer, monsoon, early autumn, late autumn and winter. These are based on the astronomical division of the 12 months into six parts. The ancient Hindu calendar also reflects these seasons in its arrangement of months. India's climate is affected by two seasonal winds -the north-east monsoon and the south-west mon- soon. The north-east monsoon commonly known as winter monsoon blows from land to sea whereas south-west monsoon known as summer monsoon blows from sea to land after crossing the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Berngal. The south-west monsoon brings most of the rainfall dur- ing the year in the country. Flora India is rich in flora. Available data places India at the tenth position in the world and fourth in Asia in plant diversity. From about 70 per cent geographical area surveyed so far, over 46,000 species of plants havebeendescribed by theBotanical Survey of India (BS), Kolkata. The vascular flora, which forms the conspicuous vegetation cover, comprises 15,000 species. With a wide range of climatic conditions from the torrid to the arctic, India has a rich and varied veg- etation, which only a few countries of comparable size possess. India can be divided into eight distinct floristic regions: the western Himalayas, the eastern Himalayas, Assam, the Indus plain, the Ganga plain, the Deccan, the Malabarand the Andamans. 21 hrs 25 mins left in book 1%

The western Himalayan region extends from Kash- mir to Kumaon. Its temperatezone is rich in forests of chir, pine, other conifers and broad-leaved tem- perate trees. Higher up, forests of deodar, blue pine, spruce and silver fir occur. The alpine zone extends from the upper limit of the temperate zone of about 4,750 metres or even higher. The characteristic trees of this zone are high-level silver fir, silver birch and junipers. The eastern Himalayan region extends from Sikkim eastwards and embraces Darjeeling, Kurseong and the adjacent tracts. The temperate zone has forests of oaks, laurels, maples, rhododen-drons, alder and birch. Many conifers, junipers and dwarf willows also grow here. The Assam region comprises the Brahmaputra and the Surma valleys with evergreen forests, occasional thick clumps of bamboos and tall grasses. The Indus plain region comprises the plains of Punjab, western Rajasthan and northern Gujarat. It is dry, hot and supports nat- ural vegetation. The Ganga plain region covers the area which is alluvial plain and is under cultivation for wheat, sugarcane and rice. Only small areas sup- port forests of widely differing types. The Deccan region comprises the entire table land of the Indian Peninsula and supports vegetation of various kinds, from shrub jungles to mixed deciduous forests. The Malabar region covers the excessively humid belt of mountain country parallel to the west-coast of the peninsula. Besides being rich in forest vegetation, this region produces importantcommercialcrops, such as coconut, betelnut, pepper, coffee, tea, rub- ber and cashewnut.The Andaman region abounds in evergreen, mangrove, beach and diluvial forests.

Arunachal Pradesh through Sikkim, Meghalaya and Nagaland and the Deccan Peninsula is rich in en- demic flora, with a large number of plants which are notfound elsewhere. The flora of the country is being studied by BSI and its nine circle/field offices located all over the country along with certain universities and research institutions. Ethno-botanical study deals with the utilisation of plants and plant products by ethnic races. A sci- entific study of such plants has been done by BSI. A number of detailed ethno-botanical explorations have been conducted in different tribal areas of the country, through which more than 800 plant species of ethno-botanical interest have been collected and identified at different centres. Owing to destruction of forests for agricultural, industrial and urban development, several Indian plants species are facing the threat of extinction. About 1,336 plant species are considered vulnerable and endangered. Around 20 species of higher plants are categorised as pos sibly extinct, as these have not been sighted during the last six to ten decades. BSI -- brings out an inventory of endangered plants in the --. form of a publication titled, Red Data Book. --. Faunal Resources India is one of the mega-biodiversity countries in the world with unique biogeographical locations, diversified climatic conditions and wide array of ecosystems, ranging from the deep sea to high mountain ranges in Himalayas.

a century old committed to inventorying the fau- nal resources of the country right from Protozoa to Mammalia. ZSI Headquarters at Kolkata and its 16 regional centres spread across the country are studying the Indian fauna of all the states, UTs and protected areas in different ecosystems. Altogether, 1,02,161 species have been documented by the ZSI from India, of which diversity of Arthropods stands tall with 76,461 species. India contributes to 6.52 per cent of the global faunal diversity with an en- demism of about 28 per cent. Among the animals reported from the country, over 2,800 species are protected under different schedules of Wildlife (Pro- tection) Act, 1972 for better conservation. According to world biogeographic classification, India represents two of the major realms, the Palearc- tic and Indo-Malayan, and three biomes: Tropical Humid Forests, Tropical Dry/Deciduous Forests and Warm Deserts/ Semi-Deserts. The Indian landmass has been classified into ten Bio-geographic Zones and ZSI documented the faunal resources in some of them: the Himalayas with 30,377 species; Trans- Himalayas with 3,324 species; Islands with 11,009 species; theNorth-East with18,527; Desert with3,324; Semi-Desertwith 7,424; and Coasts with 11,883 species. In order to protect thebiodiversity, 903protected areas that are sprawling over 5.02 per cent of the country's geographical areas have been designated, of which faunal communities have been thoroughly listed from 120 protected areas by the ZSI. In the In- dian Ocean region, India is one of the countries with high marine biodiversity that has been accounted with 20,444 species. Besides these, 9,457 specie 21 hrs 22 mins left in book 1%

from freshwater, 3,939 species from estuarine and 5,747 species from mangrove ecosystems have been recorded from the country. Among the Indian fauna, 5,632 species have been included in various cate- gories of the IUCN Red list that require some atten- tion for conservation. For effective conservation of the water bodies, 37 wetlands have been recognised as Ramsar Sites -the wetlands of international importance -in which 6,602 species of animals under different groups have been reported. Under the Man and Biosphere concept of UNESCO, 18 Biosphere Reserves have been des- ignated in India, of which Sunderban Biosphere re- serve harbours large number of species to the tune of 2,626 while in Great Nicobar -2,079 species, Nilgiri -1,875 species, Gulf of Mannar -1,086 species, Manas -846 species, Pachmarhi -795 species, Achanakmar-Amarkantak-649 species, Simlipal -539 species, Nanda Devi -427 species and Nokrek -262 species of animals have been reported. Out of 35 biodiversity hotspots identified in the world, Himalayas, Indo- Burma, Sundaland and Western Ghats -Sri Lanka are shared by India with high degree of endemism. It is presumed that the Indian faunal diversity may exceed many folds as several least studied, unknown invertebrates and microbes are yet to be explored. However, ZSI publishes the new discoveries of ani- mals from India to an extent of 350 to 400 species and new records at the rate of 150 to 200 species per annum.

The Census of India 2001, was historic and epoch making, being the first census of the twenty-first century and the third millennium. It reveals bench- mark data on the state of abundant human resources available in the country, their demography, culture and economic structure at a juncture, which marks a centennial and millenial transition. Census 2011 was the 15th census of its kind since 1872. It was held in two phases: House listing and Housing Census (April to September, 2010) and Pop- ulation Enumeration (February 9 to 28, 2011 with Revisional round during Marchlto 5, 2011). Refer- ence Date was 0.00 hour of March 1, 2011. In snow bound areas, the Population Enumeration was con- ducted from September 11 to 30, 2010. The final population data was released on April 30, 2013. Population As pertheCensus of India 2011, thepopulation of India stood at 1,210.9 million (623.2 million males and 587.6 million females) as on March 1, 2011. Out of which 833.7 million (68.9 per cent) lived in rural areas and the rest 377.1 million (31.1 per cent) lived in urban areas. With a population of 1028.7 million in 2001, the decadal growth rate of population in India between 2001 and 2011 was 17.7 per cent. The population of India is estimatedto have reached 1363.0 million in 2021 and is projected to reach 1,522.3 million by 2036.2 India accounts for only 135.79 million sq. km of the surface area, a meagre 2.4 per cent of the world surface area. Yet, it accounts for a whoppingpercentage of the world population. Population Density21 hrs 20 mins left in book 1%

One of the important indicesof population concen- tration is the density of population. It is defined as the number of persons per square kilometre (sq. kmn). The population density of India in 2011 was 382 per sq. km with a decadal growth rate of 17.7 per cent. The density of population has increased in all states and union territories between 1991 and 2011. Among the bigger states, Bihar was the most thickly populated state with a population density of 1,106 persons per sq. km followed by West Bengal at 1,028 and Kerala at 860 in 2011. Among smaller states/ union territories, the population density of NCT of Delhi was the highest at 11,320 persons per sq. km in 2011 followed by Chandigarh at 9,258 persons per sq. km. Sex Ratio Sex ratio, defined as the number of females per thousand males, is an important social indicator to measure the extent of prevailing equality between males and females in a society at a given point of time. The sex ratio in India has always remained un- favourable to females. It was 972 at the beginning of the twentieth century (1901) and thereafter showed a continuous decline until 1941 when it reached 945. The sex ratio has improved from 933 in 2001 to 943 in 2011. However, the child sex ratio (defined as the number of girls aged 0-6 years per thousand boys aged 0-6 years) has deteriorated from 927 in 2001 to 919 in 2011. LiteracyA person aged seven and above who can both read and write with understanding in any language is treated as literateas per the Census of India 2011.

erate. Prior to 1991,Censusof India treated children below five years of age as illiterates. As per Census 2011, the literacyrate in India stood at 73.0 per cent (80.9 per cent for males and 64.6 per cent for females), an increase from 64.8 per cent in 2001. Kerala retained its top position with 94.0 per cent (male 96.1 per cent, female 92.1 per cent) fol- lowed by Lakshadweep (91.8 per cent). Bihar with a literacy rate of 61.8 per cent (male 71.2 per cent and female 51.5 per cent) was the lowest in the country. Migration Migration is one of the most important indicators of demography. People migrate from one place to an- other due to various socio-economic reasons. Census of India records migration by two methods, namely: place of last residence and piace of birth. In terms of place of last residence method, migrants are de- fined as people who are currently residing at a place different from their place of last residence. In terms of place of birth method, people who are currently re- siding at a place different from their place of birth are treated as migrants. About 455.8 million people were treated as mi- grants by place of last residence, 141.9 million were considered to be migrants between the period 2001 and 2011. And a major chunk of the migrants in India (84.8 per cent) in the period 2001-2011 were within the state of enumeration. Only 15.6 per cent of migrants were considered inter-state migrants. Similarly, within the states/union territories, 64.9 per cent of the migration in the period 20012011 happened within the district of enumeration and the rest 35.1 per cent migrants were inter-district mi- grants. 21 hrs 18 mins left in book 1%

Fertility and Mortality Rates The fertilityrate (or Total Fertility Rate TFR) of a population is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were subjected to the prevailing rate of age-specific fertility in the population. A TFR of about 2.1 chill- dren per woman is called Replacement-level fertility. From a TFR of 2.6 in 2008 to 2.2 in 2018, India has gradually moved towards achieving the replacement level of fertility. Crude Birth Rate Thr Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is a measure of birth rates and is defined as the total number of live births in a year divided by the total mid-year population and multiplied by 1,000 to express it per 1,000 popu- lation. CBR in India has reached 20.0 per 1,000 popu-lation in 2018. Crude Decath Rate The Crude Death Rate (CDR) is a measure of mortal- ity rates and is defined as the total number of deaths in a year divided by the total mid-year population and multiplied by 1,000 to express it per 1,000 pop- ulation. The Crude Death Rate for India in 2018 was 6.2 per 1,000 population, gradually down from 7.4 in 2008. Infant Mortality Rate The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is another impor- tant indicator of demography and is defined as the number of deaths in a year per 1,000 live births of children under one year of age. India has been able to drastically reduce the Infant Mortality Rate from 53 in 2008 to 32 in 2018. 21 hrs 17 mins left in book 1%
