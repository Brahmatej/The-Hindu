Despite its long presence in Afghanistan, the U.S. has not been able to understand the true political dynamics between various tribal factions.  With the Taliban™s resurgence raising terror fears, from Moscow to China, New Delhi should be wary of a boost to armed insurgency in Kashmir. Kangayam R. Narasimhan, Chennai‚Bifurcation™ plan The Bharatiya Janata Party leadership in Tamil Nadu is attempting to stir up a hornet™s nest in the State with the ﬁCentre™s planﬂ of converting the western districts into a ﬁKongu Nadu Union Territoryﬂ. By attempting to whipup such parochial regional passions, the BJP is travelling on a dangerous path. Even though tall Dravidian leaders in the State were strong advocates of a ‚Dravida Nadu™, they never compromised on the unity and integrity of India.  Theparty™s national leadership needs to rein in those making such irresponsible statements. It would be foolish on the part of the BJP to foster divisive topics for narrow political gains. A.V.

To read more letters online, scan the QR code Bhaskaran Raman &  Om Damani Most schools in India have been closed since the na- tional lockdown started in March 2020. What are the costs of keeping schools closed? How do these costs compare against the risks of school reopening? We delve into these questions, as con- cerned parents with school-age children, as experienced teachers, and also as practising scientists who have followed data and publi- cations on this topic over the last 15 months. Interestingly, various regions around the world which have been worse hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic than India, have kept their schools, especially primary schools, mostly open. This in- cludes various European coun- tries such as Portugal, France, the Netherlands , etc. The  State of Flo- rida (United States ) opened schools for in-person classes in late September 2020, and they stayed open through their second wave. On the other hand in India, schools have mostly been shut even as other businesses have opened.Impact of school  closure The costs of school closure are im- mense. People make considerable investments in their childrens™ education, as a way toward a bet- ter future and a better living stan- dard. Even prior to the pandemic, there was a huge attainment gap across students, especially in high- er grades. The bottom half of chil- dren passing Class 10 are about two years behind in terms of skills. Prolonged school closure has al- ready widened this gap. What will this do to their future? Does it not push the next generation deeper into poverty? Ironically, the poor- est families living in dense urban slums, who bore the brunt of the †rst wave, and are now largely im- mune from the virus itself (as shown by serosurveys), are the ones su“ering the most from school closures. Asurvey (https:// bit.ly/3xzZ7mx) across 10 States in India in November 2020 estimated that nearly two-thirds of children in rural India may drop out of school, a staggering statistic which is likely to have worsened with continuing closure. Haryana has reported (https://bit.ly/3r64dV5) a 42% drop in student enrol ment in private schools. Prolonged school shutdown has severely set back In- dia™s †ght against ills such as child labour (https://bit.ly/3e9H7HE) and child marriage (https:// bit.ly/36AevTK). Due to the  shut- down of schools, mid-day meal schemes have been disrupted; even as early as June 2020, it was estimated (https://bit.ly/3r2AfkG) that about 800,000 additional children would face underweight and wasting. Health, well-being concerns Even in well-o“ urban India and in developed nations, extended school closure is having a severe impact on children™s mental health. In Las Vegas, U.S., a surge of student suicides (https://ny- ti.ms/2UIjYpb) forced schools to reopen in January 2021. The Unit- ed Kingdom reported (https:// bit.ly/3r2Ftx3) a 40% rise in the number of children taking antidepressants. Surely, life is more important than education. But as examples above show, schools are not mere- ly about education. Given the costs of prolonged school shutdown, we must probe deeper into the risks of opening schools in the context of COVID-19.  Assessing the risk factor First, we must realis e, and be grateful that the risk of COVID -19 for children is much lower than for adults, and is also much lower than other (already small) risks children face in daily life anyway. Based on a study of 137 million school-age children in the U.S. and Europe, Prof. Raj S. Bhopal (Un- iversity of Edinburgh, U.K.) has observe d ((https://bit.ly/3wzt3h6) that COVID -19 in this age group is less than half as risky as seasonal in‘uenza, and over 20 times less risky than death by ﬁunintentional injuryﬂ.  Astudy (https://bit.ly/2Vq94oa) among the nearly two million chil- dren in Sweden (where schools have been open throughout), found that there was not a single child death due to COVID-19. As per Mumbai™s dashboard data, the COVID -19 IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) for under-19 is minu scule: about 0.003% . In comparison, the infant mortality rate in India is about 3% (1,000 times greater) and the infant mortality rate in Ja- pan (one of the lowest) is 0.18% (60 times greater). In other words, school-age children are at a neglig- ibly lower risk from COVID -19 when compared to other threats which we consider normal. There has been a concern that a possible third wave involving new- er variants could a“ect children. But a careful look at the data (https://bit.ly/3xEm73Q) tells that the age-pro†les of those a“ected in the second and †rst waves are si- milar. There is no scienti†c basis for this fear. Further, Public Health England™s June 2021 report (https://bit.ly/3B3ALnp) shows that the newer variant Delta is much less dangerous (case fatality rate 0.1%) than the original (case fatality rate 1.9%), which is the ex- pected evolutionary path of a virus.Teachers as ‚essential™ sta† The next question is: are teachers and parents at higher risk of catch- ing COVID -19 if schools reopen? Over the last year there have been several careful scienti†c studies (https://bit.ly/3kdibTA) across va- rious regions in Europe/U.S. , mea- suring the role of in-person classes in COVID-19spread. The over- whelming conclusion is that the risk of COVID-19 spread in schools is minimal compared to other lo- cations. To further reduce the con- cern among teachers, the G overn- ment must treat them on a par with essential workers, and o“er them prioritised vaccination. Despite this, it is likely that a ﬁone-size-†ts-allﬂ approach may not be suitable, as each indivi- dual™s risk-bene†t analysis could be di“erent. For children who lack the resources, whose parents have to go out to work every day, in-per- son schooling is paramount. Pa- rents who can a“ord to work from homehave su’cient resources for their children and may choose to continue with partially or fully on- line classes for a few more months. It is high time to imple- ment such di“erentiated options. Vaccines for children There has recently been talk about tying school reopening to vaccines for children. Any medical inter- vention, especially for children, must be based on a careful risk-be- ne†t analysis. It is pertinent to note that there are growing con- cerns (https://cnn.it/3r8MnAH) in the U.S.of a potential link between heart in‘ammation and the mRNA vaccine, among adolescents. Further, scientists writing in The British Medical Journal (May 2021) note (https://bit.ly/36xCpPP): ﬁthe rarity of severe Covid-19 outcomes for children means that trials can- not demonstrate that the balance of the bene†ts of vaccination against the potential adverse ef- fects are favourable...ﬂ. It will like- ly take several years to establish such a balance. We cannot let our children su“er for that long, by further prolonging school closures. More than the virus, fear stands between our children and their education and normal life. Policy- makers must make evidence- based decisions toward school re- opening. This is the least the work- ing class and the children of India deserve. Bhaskaran Raman and Om Damani are faculty members at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay.

In all the last three elections in the State (2017, 2012, 2007),  most reporters and analysts were incorrect in predicting a  tantalisingly close †ght. The results, on the other hand, revealed a clear single-party majority each time, including the biggest wave in almost four de- cades in the last election. At the outset, we must account for this repeated failure to foresee emerging trends in Uttar Pradesh politics. A large part of the blame can be laid on the obsessive focus on castearithmetic, heuristic cate- gories frozen from the 1990s, that often blurs the larger picture. The big lesson from the last 15 years is that the State of Uttar Pradesh has moved from a rigid identity polit- ics of caste and community to a fo- cus on identity plus governance. A large ‘oating voter population has gradually emerged, spanning across demography, which is †er- cely calculative, and driven by as- pirations for a better life.  State™s transition This has powered the transition of Uttar Pradesh, from the messy fragmentation of the coalition era of the 1990s and early 2000s, to the era of stable, single party ma- jorities. Although caste and com- munity identities remain impor- tant, Uttar Pradesh voters, like elsewhere, have little patience for misgovernance Š they have thrown out every incumbent go- vernment since 1989.  But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has reasons to be con†dent of bucking the trend. The sheer scale of its  victory in 2017 provides it with a formidable cushion. It received a voteshare of almost 40% in the last election, with an average constituency-level winning margin of an incredible 15%.  It is quite conceivable for the party to lose a signi†cant chunk of its vote in the next elections, and still emerge with a majority. In comparison, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) received a majority, with 30% and 29% of the vote share, respectively.  Factors behind the mandates There are two ways of reading the massive 2017 mandate of the BJP. The †rstis to read it as a historical break where the BJP™s ideological triumph fundamentally re-con†- gured the caste-community voting patterns of the State. The second  is to readit in the context of the last 15years, where a large ‘oating vo- ter population, frustrated with the incumbent, ‘ocked behind the clearest alternative. In this frame- work, just as the 2007 and 2012 majorities did not re‘ect a long- term realignment in favour of Ba- hujan (or ‚sarvajan™) politics or Lo- hiaite socialism, the enormous mandate received by the BJP in 2017 was also not exclusively a function of Hindutva.  In all three cases, the success of the social engineering or ideologi- cal messaging crafted by the even- tual winner was contingent on their party becoming the vehicle for the electorate™s accumulated resentments and aspirations, shaped by the speci†c failures of the incumbent. Under the rubric of Hindu identity, and the leader- ship of Narendra Modi, the BJP be- came the vehicle for an electorate angry with the crime, corruption and Yadav favouritism under the Samajwadi Party government. The backdrop of communal riots and the increased presence of Muslims in the local power elite, added to this glue of this Hindu consolidation. However, as the ascension of BJP from 1991-98 in the S tate, and the subsequent decline for two de- cades demonstrated, Hindu con- solidation in a State like Uttar Pra- desh could be an ephemeral phenomenon.Incumbent and prospects If the underpinnings of the BJP mandate of 2017 were indeed con- textual rather than absolute, the BJP can indeed be dislodged from power in the State, provided there are two conditions: one, the pre- sence of strong anti-incumbency; and two, the emergence of a clear alternative that transforms the election from a multi-polar to a lar- gely bi-polar contest.  Let us come to the †rst ques- tion: is there a high level of anti-in- cumbency against the Yogi Aditya- nath government that can hurt its prospects? In choosing Mr. Adityanath, a relative lightweight outside of his bastion in Gorakhpur, to lead the State government, the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah team made two bets, informed by the party™s pre- vious experience in the State.  First, only hard line Hindutva could contain caste contradictions and lead to a durable Hindu coali- tion. In the wake of the Ram Jan- mabhoomi movement, the BJP had assembled a powerful coali- tion of upper castes, upwardly mobile castes such as Jats and Guj- jars, and Other Backward Classes (OBC) such as Kurmis and Lodhs. This Hindutva coalition, however, soon came apart from internal strife between the upper caste and the OBC factions, culminating in the expulsion of the OBC Kalyan Singh from the party in 1999.  Second, only an authoritative style of leadership could maintain Hindu unity and also create a go- vernance constituency. The large- ly collective leadership of the 1990s and early 2000sŠ in which the BJP installed three di“erent Chief Ministers Š had provided a confused and disunited front, and consequently failed to compete with Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav.  Both of these bets, have, argua- bly, not paid o“ for the BJP. One, as apolitical outsider to Lucknow, the †rst thing Mr. Adityanath did was build his own political sup- port base on his Thakur identity. Much like previous leaders, Mr. Adityanath †lled S tate institutions, be it zilla parishads, civil servants or station house o’cers, with his own castemen to wield direct power over the administration. The frequent allegations of ‚Tha- kur vaad ™ or Thakur domination against his administration sug- gests that Mr. Adityanath has not so far proved to be a leader with a pan-Hindu appeal in the mould of Mr. Modi.  Two, the authoritative style of governance has provided indi“e- rent results. While Mr. Adityanath does possess some governance ap- peal Š having a relatively clean and ‚tough on crime™ image Š he has largely been unable to asso- ciate himself with either a social welfare constituency or marquee developmental projects. On top of it, the novel coronavirus pandem- ic has severely diminished his go- vernance credentials; any im- provement in the ease of business index pales in comparison to im- ages of bodies ‘oating in the Gan- ga. The dramatic S tate failure dur- ing the second wave of the pandemic also threatens to be- come a coalescing point for all the material anxieties persisting un- der the surface, such as unemploy- ment, sluggish growth and farmer distress.  The aspirations of the ‘oating voters whodeserted Ms. Mayawati in 2012, and Akhilesh Yadav in 2017, has, arguably, remained un- ful†lled under Mr. Adityanath™s re- gime.  Where the Opposition stands This brings us to the second ques- tion: is there a clear alternative that transforms the election from a multi-polar to a largely bi-polar contest?  Aquick scan of the O pposition ranks indicates that only the SP presently possesses the strength to challenge the BJP.  The BSP under Ms. Mayawati has been in constant decline in the State from 2012. The party has lost touch with its roots in political ac- tivism for a long time now, and its organis ation has withered away under an insular leadership. The steady desertion of leaders gives further evidence of a party in a death spiral. Similarly, there are little signs of a Congress revival, the latest indications being its dis- astrous returns in the panchayat elections. All of this plays well into the SP™s strategy of making this electo- ral contest into a largely bipolar race. A perception of a straight †ght between the SP and the BJP might well consolidate local elites, and a disgruntled electorate, be- hind the party symbol. But there are reasonable grounds to doubt whether the SP can defeat the BJP in a bipolar race. For one, the par- ty has never crossed the 30% vote share mark in State elections.  In order to defeat the BJP, the SP party would need to go well beyond plebeian caste consolida- tion and minority insecurity, and court ‘oating voters with a broad- based, positive message of deve- lopment. In this regard, Akhilesh Yadav can borrow from his own template of 2012, where he ran a successful campaign focused on employment, electricity and edu- cation.  The choice of Mr. Adityanath was essentially informed more through the lenses of ideologically cementing the Hindu vote rather than the ful†lment of the gover- nance aspirations of the ‘oating voter. If the BJP manages to fritter away its enormous mandate, it would derive from the same source of hubris that felled pre- vious incumbents: overly reading into the mandate its own inge- nious social engineering or sweep- ing ideological triumph rather than the contextual aspirations and resentments that underlay it.

That No- vak Djokovic comes through this most searing of exam- inations with ‘ying colours is a testament to his genius. On Sunday, the Serb laid down the most de†nitive marker yet of his dazzling brilliance by pulling level with the celebrated duo on 20 Grand Slam singles titles. Atense four-set victory over Italy™s Matteo Berrettini al- so gave Djokovic his third straight title at the All E n- gland club (sixth overall) and helped complete the French Open-Wimbledon double, one of sport™s tough- est achievements. Djokovic™s record-equalling feat h ad seemed improbable as recently as the summer of 2018. As a 31-year-old, he entered that year™s Wimbledon a sthe 12th seed after having spent two years  on the fring- es. Federer and Nadal, gaining second winds, had swept the previous six Slams and were already on 20 and 17 respectively. But Djokovic rediscovered his mojo and has since won eight of 12 Majors, the most domi- nant streak of his career. He has conquered Federer on grass and Nadal on clay, and  snu“ed out rebellions from the game™s ‚Next Gen™ of Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medve- dev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Berrettini, beating them for his last four Slam trophies. So much so that he now feels the ﬁmost completeﬂ he has ever been as a player.  The accomplishments have inevitably reignited the debate on who the greatest men™s player of all time  is. While comparisons between eras  are often limited and come with caveats Šthink the great Pancho Gonzales being denied chances to compete in Majors in the 1950s because he had turned professional Š Djokovic is with- out doubt the best of his generation. This week will be his record 329th as World No.1 and he is the only man to have won all four Slams, all nine ATP Masters 1000s and the year-ending ATP Finals, twice. No other statistic better represents his relentless pursuit of excellence ,across surfaces, continents and seasons. At the US Open starting next month, he has a shot at sporting im- mortality, as he can become the †rst man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Majors in a single year. Ash- leigh Barty may be a long way from such monumental successes, but like Djokovic, she has proved adept at mastering the game™s natural surfaces by adding the Wimbledon crown to the French title she won in 2019. The 25-year-old Aussie™s craft and guile was fully on dis- play as she felled opponents as chalk and cheese as An- gelique Kerber (counter-puncher) and Karolina Plisko -va (all-out attacker). With modesty in her bones, she oozes an enviably understated elegance, something the tennis world is sure to see more and more of.  Tie at the top Djokovic is in pursuit of history,  not just tournament titles The Supreme Court of India™s verdict last week, upholding the authority of a committee of the Delhi Assembly to summon a senior o’cial of Fa- cebook, is an extremely nuanced recognition of the ex- tent of powers of State Assemblies in matters regulated by an Act of Parliament. The question mark about the powers arose in the †rst place because Facebook, whose India vice-president Ajit Mohan was repeatedly summoned by Delhi Assembly™s Committee  on Peace and Harmony on the subject of the Delhi riots of 2020, argued before the Supreme Court that this was a case of overreach; and that Delhi™s law and order came under the central government. This was also the position t a- ken by the central government, which argued that the Delhi Assembly had no jurisdiction in this matter. T he social media platform also pointed out that it was go- verned by the IT Act of Parliament, and this is no t there- fore something that any State government can be con- cerned with. The Court, in upholding the summons, did not go merely by the legislative powers of a House. It rightly said, ﬁThe Assembly does not only perform the function of legislating; there are many other aspects of governance which can form part of the essential functions of the Legislative Assembly and consequently the committee.ﬂ Its point was that the ﬁinquisitorialﬂ and ﬁrecommendatoryﬂ powers of a House can be used for better governance. But it also cautioned the commit- tee from ﬁtransgressing into any †elds reserved for the Union Government ﬂ.Signi†cantly, the verdict comes amid a long phase of discordance over legislative turf between the c entral government and the Delhi g overnment, something that the B ench led by Justice S.K. Kaul did note amid discus- sions about the spirit of federalism. Not just that. It also comes at a time when social media intermediaries are legally †ghting some aspects of the new IT rules that govern them. Their responsibility toward the many le -gislatures will only become more heightened because of this verdict. The C ourt refused to buy the argument that social media intermediaries are ﬁmerely a platform for exchange of ideas without performing any signi†- cant role themselvesﬂ. It then linked what happens i nthese platforms to the real world. Misinformation on social media, the Court said, has had ﬁa direct impa ct on vast areas of subject matter which ultimately a“e ct the governance of States ﬂ. Given the constraints of the powers of the Delhi Assembly vis-à-vis law and order, the very fact that the C ourt found that its committee still could summon the Facebook India o’cial without encroaching upon the turf of the Centre now opens the gates for scrutiny of social media platforms by other States, which however have signi†cantly more powers with respect to law and order. The stage is set for more scrutiny.

In  A New Cold War: Henry Kissinger and the Rise of China , edited by San- jaya Baru and Rahul Sharma, aca- demic and diplomat Kishore Mahbu- bani explains America™s place in the world in his essay ‚Evil Liberalism versus Moral Pragmatism™. He as- serts that by abandoning Kissinger™s realist pragmatism, the U.S.  has be- come ﬁseverely weakened both dom- estically and externallyﬂ. An excerpt: The year 2021 marks the 50th  an- niversary of Henry Kissinger™s fa- mous visit to China in July 1971. It also marks, more or less, the 30th  anni- versary of the end of the Cold War. With some risk of being accused of over-simpli†cation, one can say in the 20 years after Kissinger™s visit to China, U.S. foreign policy was guided by the philosophy of realist pragma- tism. By contrast, in the 30  years af- ter the end of the Cold War, it was guided by the philosophy of liberal idealism.  The results are clear. Real- ist pragmatism delivered the greatest victory of American foreign policy: a victory over the mighty Soviet Union without the U.S. †ring a shot at Soviet armed forces. By contrast, the past 30 years have generated a lot of evil.  Collateral damage  Between 2004 and 2019, the U.S. Air Force dropped 175,842 bombs on several countries, according to the U.S. Air Forces Central Command. Bombs dropped from the air are of- ten not accurate. Hence, many inno- cent people were killed. The Brown University Watsons Institute™s Cost of War Project estimates the total ca- sualties from all post-9/11 wars at 770,000 to 801,000 casualties. The results are clear: when ethical do- gooders take over the U.S. foreign policy, evil is generated: $5.1 trillion wasted; almost 800,000 lives lost.  Yet, the biggest damage done by the abandonment of Kissingerian realist pragmatism is that the U.S. has become severely weakened both domestically and externally. Inter- nally, the  30-year period of liberal- idealist domination of the U.S. fo- reign policy has coincided with a  30- year period of stagnation of working class incomes. Externally, the U.S. lit- erally fell asleep at the wheel while China rose dramatically. In 1980, in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, China™s gross national pro- duct (GNP) was 10% of that of the U.S. By 2014, it had become bigger. Now there is no doubt that the biggest fo- reign policy challenge the U.S. faces in the next three decades is China. So, how should the U.S. manage China? The main argument of this es- say is that the U.S. needs to engage in deep re“ection on what went drasti- cally wrong. The U.S. made a major mistake in abandoning realist prag- matism and switching to liberal idealism. A return to Kissingerian realist pragmatism would be the best way to manage a rising China. Kissinger™s celebrated ‚secret™ visit to Beijing in July 1971 is widely and justi†ably regarded as a major move that swung the ‚correlation of forces™ in America™s favour and led to the ul- timate victory over the Soviet Union. What was remarkable about the wi- despread applause that this visit re- ceived, including from  The New York Times  and  The Washington Post , is that so few Americans mentioned that the U.S. was embracing a regime in China led by Mao Zedong, which had only recently created havoc in the country, leading to enormous hu- man pain and su‘ering through the disastrous policies of the Great Leap Forward (1958-61) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76).  In short, human rights were a se- condary consideration when realist pragmatism reigned. Indeed, at the International Conference on Kampu- chea of July 13-17,1981, the U.S. dele- gation, led by Alexander Haig, ac- tually supported China against the ASEAN countries, when China said that the Khmer Rouge should be al- lowed to return to power in Phnom Penh after the Vietnamese withdra- wal. I was personally present and shocked when this happened. Yet the same Reagan administration, in a more ‚liberal™ move, supported the removal of the dictator [Ferdinand] Marcos from the Philippines. In short, even in the realist-pragmatic era, there were liberal elements.  Kissinger wasn™t the only major †- gure advocating realist pragmatism. Other major thinkers of that era did so, including George Kennan and Zbigniew Brzezinski. While Kennan is often associated with the harsh policy of ‚containment™ of the Soviet Union, John Mearsheimer reminds us that Kennan was a shrewd and so- phisticated thinker. Firstly, he em- phasised that the outcome of the Cold War would not be determined by the size of their respective armed forces. Instead, it would depend on the ‚spiritual vitality™ of their domes- tic societies. This is what he had said: ‚It is rather a question of the degree to which the U.S. can create among the peoples of the world generally the impression of a country which knows what it wants, which is coping successfully with the problems of its internal life and with the responsibil- ities of a World Power, and which has aspiritual vitality capable of holding its own among the major ideological currents of the time.™ He also called for ‚greater humility in our national outlook.™ According to Mearsheimer, his call for humility was in response to a strong claim made by then Secre- tary of State Madeleine Albright in February 1998, when she had said, ‚If we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensa- ble nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us.™ Kennan lived to the ripe old age of 101 and died in 2005. Hence, he lived through the †rst 15 years of the post- Cold War era. Signi†cantly, he also disapproved of the many key moves when the U.S. switched from realist pragmatism to liberal idealism. He disapproved of the expansion of NA- TO into the former Soviet bloc. Ken- nan also disapproved of the invasion of Iraq. ‚Delusions of superiority™ Dick Cheney con†dently asserted that U.S. troops would be welcomed in Iraq. He said, ‚I really do believe that we will be greeted as liberators.™ Mearsheimer observes that in con- trast to such beliefs that the U.S. was morally superior, Kennan did not be- lieve that the U.S. was more virtuous in any meaningful way. Indeed, Ken- nan observed that Americans were su‘ering from ‚delusions of superior- ity™. Kennan strongly argued against the U.S. taking a ‚paternalistic res- ponsibility to anyone, be it even in the form of military occupation™.  Many of the points raised here will be disputed. Yet, there is no doubt that the policies of restraint and pragmatism, advocated by people like Kissinger and Kennan in the Cold War era, contrast signi†cantly with the liberal idealism of the post-Cold War era, as demonstrated by the statement of Democrats like Albright and Republicans like George W. Bush. These contrasting approaches also explain American success of the Cold War era and the failures of the post-Cold War era.

Alarm was immediately given and the whole audience was safely brought out. Un- fortunately one of the †lms caught †re and though attempts were made by means of †re extinguishers to control “ames, the scarcity of water prevented anything substantial be- ing done. Just then a big dust-storm came along and within a very short time the whole building was completely gutted. Mr. Madan and his sta‘ saved all †lms stored in the pre- mises, all pianos and as much of the furni- ture as could be brought out. They were as- sisted by the military and police on duty and members of the general public. But for this voluntary assistance, nothing could have been saved, so sudden was the con“agra- tion. The municipal †re engines arrived on the spot twenty minutes after the †re and were unable to do anything until water was obtained after another 20 minutes. The †re was brought under control about midnight. AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 13, 1921 Fire in cinema There have been a lot of deliberations on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat™s speech on July 5 during a book launch function in Ghaziabad.  The speech carries many †rsts and sends a mes- sage  to both Hindus and Muslims. Discus- sions in the media and in social and political groups may be taking place  on the content of the speech, but there is no denying  that it has ushered in a ray of hope for harmony. Abold speech Mr. Bhagwat stressed on two major issues, peaceful coexistence and initiating a dia- logue for a composite culture, to be attained by safeguarding and following our own reli- gious practices,  cultures, and attire. Nothing is left for a tussle when the two communities share a motherland, culture, and ancestors. Mr. Bhagwat™s speech has to be viewed in its entirety. The time has come for  a new be- ginning. His  bold outreach needs to be reci- procated. There may be issues, concerns, and even irritants during this journey but we have to overcome all this . Treading a peace- ful path is the need of the hour. There are many points in Mr. Bhagwat™s speech which we have to agree with without discussion. India is the motherland for  boththe communities. He has shunned the appre- hension regarding  his remarks Š there is no need for confrontation. The fact that such a statement comes from the RSS chief itself de- notes that Muslims should not live with any fear psychosis. When Mr. Bhagwat said  that the DNA of Hindus and Muslims is the same and they have the same ancestors, it shows that proving one™s Muslim identity does not hold much ground. It is true that incidents of mob lynching of Muslims are a matter of concern as they have endangered the life and security of the com- munity. Mr. Bhagwat categorically con- demned all such lynching incidents. He said that those who indulge in lynching are against Hindutva. The law should take its own course against such people without any partiality. Mr. Bhagwat said Muslims should not live in a cycle of fear. This could  instill con†- dence in the community. It is a fact that there is  fear and apprehension in the community .There is no space for †rebrand sloganeering that Islam is in danger, Muslims will be evict- ed, etc. Mr. Bhagwat himself candidly admit- ted that he can become popular with such rhetoric speeches but Hindus will them- selves not support him. The message from Mr. Bhagwat™s speech is also for the majority community. The fringe elements need to learn lessons from it . The sensationalisation of statements, such as  ‚noMuslims will live here™, may get space in the media, but the majority community does not approve of such an attitude. The RSS chief has highlighted the fact that there may have been some mistakes and excesses in the past, but we have to move forward. He  has also drawn a line for the political situation in the country.  Unity emanates from camarade- rie,  not from politics. It will come from the continuous e‘orts of  enlightened people, not through politics. Emphasising unity Not long before Mr. Bhagwat™s speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered an impor- tant speech to the Muslim community at the centenary celebrations of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in  2020. His speech  was appreciated in India and abroad for empha- sising unity while achieving  common nation- al goals such as Aatmanirbharta, women™s education, preservation of cultural heritage and equality of opportunity, while de-em- phasising political and ideological di‘erences. It is within this framework that the speeches of both Mr.  Modi and Mr. Bhagwat have to be appreciated. These are  genuine at- tempts to engage with the community. More importantly, it is crucial that this be recipro- cated by the Muslim community through dialogue. AMU can play an important role in facilitating this dialogue. Section 5(2)(b) of the AMU Act confers the university with the mission to promote the study of the  reli- gions, culture and civilisation of India. To- wards this, the AMU,  in its centenary year, established the Dara Shikoh Centre for Inter- faith Dialogue. Dara Shikoh, a Mughal prince, was the founder of the academic movement for Hindu-Muslim dialogue .For centuries, the two communities have lived in unity sharing a  motherland, culture, and ancestors. Throughout the course of his- tory, our rulers were di‘erent, but the coun- try has remained one. This is what makes our Bharat unique. This is the message from this ancient land to the entire world. Any dia- logue must take lessons from the past,  live in the present and chart a peaceful path for the future. Let us move ahead with open hearts and minds.

As a child, his mother had prophesied that her son would become a great ruler one day. The Prosperity Party the former in- telligence o’cer launched, disband- ing the multi-party coalition that brought him to power, is said to de- rive its name from an evangelical faith. Whatever his predilections, the Ethiopian leader has, since being ca- tapulted to premiership in April 2018, stumbled from one crisis to another, imperilling the country™s re- cent economic record. Use of force When Mr. Abiy commanded a mili- tary o‘ensive in November in retalia- tion against a Tigray rebel attack on federal army barracks, his reputation as a reformer and peacemaker alrea- dy lay in ruins. He dismissed opposi- tion to the use of force, insisting that the law-and-order operation would be wound up within weeks. For months, he denied the involvement of neighbouring Eritrean forces in the con“ict. In March, Mr. Abiy  li- kened Tigrayan †ghters to ﬁ“our dis- persed by the wind.ﬂ But events on the ground tell another story. Thousands of civilians have been killed by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces and Tigrayan militias. Addis Ababa stands accused by the United Nations and Amnesty Interna- tional of war crimes, ethnic cleansing and the resort to rape and hunger as weapons of war. The unilateral cease†re Mr. Abiy declared on June 28, purportedly on humanitarian grounds, carries little credibility, as Tigray continues to re- main crippled by a blockade of essen- tial supplies and communication and electricity blackouts. The U.S., Ethio- pia™s long-standing military ally, has imposed sanctions on  several top of- †cials and the European Union has suspended millions of dollars in aid.  Meanwhile, after recapturing the regional capital Mekelle in late June, the rebel Tigray Defense Forces have taken thousands of Ethiopian troops as prisoners of war. They have de- manded the withdrawal of all federal forces loyal to Mr. Abiy, besides an in- dependent investigation into Ethio- pian and Eritrean atrocities. The Ti- gray People™s Liberation Front (TPLF), the dominant party in the Ethiopian People™s Revolutionary De- mocratic Front (EPRDF)™s autocratic rule until 2018, is resurgent. The or- ganisation, which Mr. Abiy has dubbed a ﬁcriminal clique,ﬂ has stayed outside his Prosperity Party. Debretsion Gebremichael, the Pre- sident of TPLF,  has raised the spectre of the territory asserting its right to self-determination under the 1995 constitution in view of its deepening distrust with Addis Ababa. Mr. De- bretsion has also not ruled out TPLF retaliation against Eritrean atrocities in the ongoing con“ict. Eritrea™s strongman President Isaias Afwerki, who signed the landmark 2018 peace deal with Mr. Abiy, has now allied with him, possibly to avenge his country™s bloody defeat against a TPLF-led Ethiopian government in the 1998-2000 border war. Growing resentment The volatile atmosphere is a far cry from the euphoria in 2018 when Mr. Abiy released political prisoners , lift- ed the ban on opposition parties and welcomed exiles home. An Oromo, the ethnic community that consti- tutes more than a third of Ethiopia™s population, Mr. Abiy ™s elevation symbolised the redressal of the coun- try™s political imbalance. Tigrayans, who form less than 10% of the popu- lace, had wielded power dispropor- tionate to their strength for 28 years under the EPRDF coalition. In the event, the Oromos™ enthusiasm to assert their new-found freedom proved unsustainable and the Ti- grayans began to resent the erosion of political in“uence. Matters reached a head when Ti- gray held provincial polls in Septem- ber 2020, defying Addis Ababa™s de- cision to defer general elections nationally in view of the pandemic. The ballot was eventually held on June 21, but not in at least 100 consti- tuencies. Although Mr. Abiy has predictably won the election, the se- cond most populated nation in Africa is at a crossroads. Garimella Subramaniam is Director - Strategic Initiatives, AgnoShin Tecchnologies Pvt Ltd Ethiopia™s political tug of war The con†ict between PM Abiy Ahmed™s party and the Tigray People™s Liberation Front is escalating Garimella Subramaniam The Defence and External A‘airs Ministers to-day [New Delhi, July 12] spoke reassuring- ly in Parliament about India™s preparedness on both the western and eastern fronts to meet any Pakistani threat, while deploring strongly the continued supply of U.S. arms to the military rulers of Pakistan. The De- fence Minister, Mr. Jagjivan Ram, assured the Lok Sabha, in the course of his reply to the seven-hour debate on the budget de- mands for the defence forces, that despite Pakistan™s frantic e‘orts to augment its mili- tary strength, India still retained a decisive edge in almost every sphere. In his reply to the calling attention motion of the supply of American arms to Pakistan, the External Af- fairs Minister, Mr. Swaran Singh, disclosed that in addition to numerous verbal repre- sentations made at the highest level, India had also protested in writing on June 27 to the U.S. Government against the dangerous implications of this action. He told the Lok Sabha that the Government of India felt that the ﬁthe supply of arms to Pakistan by any country in the present context amounts to condonation of the genocide in Bangla Desh and encouragement to the continuation of the atrocities by the Military rulers of Pakis- tan.ﬂ FIFTY YEARS AGO  JULY 13, 1971 Concern over U.S. arms for Pak.
