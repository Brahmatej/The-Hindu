Mahinda Rajapaksa paid no heed to India™s entreaties after the civil war ended, to devolve more powers to the Tamil areas. The brothers are even less likely to pay attention now. Beijing™s vice-like grip on Sri Lankan politics will only get stronger now. The brothers are sharply aware of India™s own majoritarian turn as well as its troubles with China at the border and in the region. That the Rajapaksas will continue using Beijing as a counter-weight to Delhi is a reality. S.S. Paul, Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal Exit from Kerala It is true that many industrialists, real estate companies and corporate sectors face harassment from politicians and government agencies  for various reasons. As the Kitex group has also entered the political arena in Kerala (‚Pro†les™ page, ‚Kitex Group Œ Business and politics™, July 11), and with quite a few successes, established  political heavyweights must have sensed a threat. It is indeed unfortunate that politics could have resulted in Kerala losing a huge investment opportunity .There is no harm in corporate entities getting into politics. We have some examples in Parliament.  J.P. Reddy, Nalgonda, Telangana Professional conduct As a commoner, with no formal education or su“cient knowledge of our Constitution, acts, laws and rules, I feel prompted to raise some innocent questions in connection with the article, ﬁThe bar on criticism that muzzles the advocateﬂ (Editorial page, July 10). Is it advisable to leave unnoticed ‚disparaging statements™ by any advocate about courts, judges, Bar Councils and members of Bar Councils, or, for that matter, by any citizen about any other citizen? Are not disciplinary proceedings a form of remedy to the situation? Does not the subject come under professional conduct and etiquette? Is not the Bar Council of India the proper agency to issue amendments to rules in respect of advocates? If the mandatory approval of the Chief Justice of India for such amendments is not obtained, the Council looks to be at fault, which surely needs recti†cation. Thenow-in-abeyance rules have already exempted ‚healthy and bona †de™ criticism, made in ‚good faith™ from the purview of the new rules. The writer of the article should be con†dent that the report of the Review Committee, and its scrutiny by the CJI, should solve the issue amicably .P.R.V. Raja.

Narayanan, Navi Mumbai on judges in an attempt to in’uence verdicts in high pro†le cases (Inside pages, ﬁJudge recuses from Mamata™s election caseﬂ, July 8). The Supreme Court should adopt a policy of zero tolerance towards covert attempts to intimidate judges into withdrawing from cases assigned to them. Supreme Court judge Kaushik Chanda did not score any moral victory by recusing himself from the Mamata Banerjee election case, notwithstanding his indignant assertions about his professional integrity. It is a victory for his maligners because he has unwittingly created a moral hazard of emboldening powerful interests to interfere in the administration of justice.

Pant &  Mauro Bonavita One of the signs of India™s growing centrality in the In- do-Paci†c strategic archi- tecture is its burgeoning engage- ment with key western nations. Even countries which have been lackadaisical in their regional out- reach so far have begun to ap- proach the Indo-Paci†c with a new seriousness and have been reach- ing out to New Delhi.  The growth of India™s weight in Indo-Paci†c ašairs comes at a time when it is becoming clearer that complex regional geopolitical pro- blems cannot be addressed adeq- uately by rigid and structured tra- ditional alliance frameworks. This aspect is even more evident in the context of the Indo-Paci†c, where the geographical vastness of the area and the criticality of the chal- lenges posed by China™s assertive initiatives clash with a region lack- ing multilateral organisations cap- able of solving problems ešectively. But as a new pushback against China takes shape and as Indian foreign policy becomes strategi- cally clearer, there is a new mo- mentum to initiatives such as the Quad. Countries that share similar values and face similar challenges are coming together to create pur- pose-oriented partnerships. In do- ing so, they are making it possible for participating nations to ad- dress speci†c common challenges, from maritime security to a coor- dinated pandemic response, in- cluding consolidating and further developing strong reciprocal trade relationships, without compro- mising the political autonomy of each participant. Italy™s outreach Recently, Italy has also begun to signal its intention to enter the In- do-Paci†c geography. It has done so by seeking to join India and Ja- pan in a trilateral partnership. This initiative comes after years of Rome™s relative absence from the geopolitical ašairs of the region as it sought to concentrate more on the Atlantic and European dimen- sions while maintaining good, al- beit well below potential, bilateral relations with India.  The Italian government headed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi has started to pay attention out- side its immediate neighbourhood again. At the same time, Italy has become more vocal on the risks emanating from China™s strategic competitive initiatives. Recently, Mr. Draghi  described Chinese competitive practices as ﬁunfairﬂ and invited the European Union (EU) to be franker and more cour- ageous in confronting Beijing on its violations of human rights, reit- erating that with respect to China ﬁthe reciprocal visions of the world are very dišerent ﬂ.On the Indian side, there is great interest in forging new part- nerships with like-minded coun- tries interested in preserving peace and stability in the Indo- Paci†c. During a recent India-Italy- Japan trilateral, organis ed by the Italian embassies in India and Ja- pan, Riva Ganguly Das, Secretary (East) of the Ministry of External Ašairs, reiterated that the respon- sibility of keeping the Indo-Paci†c free and open, and working for the welfare of its inhabitants falls on like-minded countries within and beyond the region.  Need for a clear strategy With the expression of interest on the Italian side, the †rst step to- wards this trilateral has been ta- ken, yet it needs to evolve into so- mething more signi†cant. The Italian government must formu- late a clear Indo-Paci†c strategy that must indicate its objectives and, above all, the means and in- itiatives it is willing to implement on its own and in cooperation with its partners. Italy™s tendency to privilege diplomatic action through the mechanisms of the  EUcan be a resource for consolidat- ing the EU-India strategic relation- ship. But Rome must go beyond that in de†ning and implement- ing, at the margins of the EU™s common initiatives, its own policy with respect to the Indo-Paci†c.  Trilateral cooperation is key The India, Italy and Japan trilateral initiative can, and should, be a fo- rum to foster and consolidate a strategic relationship between these three countries, and speci†- cally expand India-Italy bilateral relations. As it stands, relations between Rome and Tokyo are his- torically strong, and those bet- ween New Delhi and Tokyo are a strategic pillar of the free and open Indo-Paci†c. A trilateral cooperation can be the right fo- rum for India and Italy to learn more from each other™s practices and interests and consolidate a strategic dialogue that should in- clude the economic, the security and the political dimensions. The next G20 leaders™ summit in Rome, in October, before the pre- sidency handover to India in 2023, should be the right opportunity for further trilateral coordination on economic and political issues at an institutional level. To consoli- date the trilateral cooperation in this †eld, the three countries need to de†ne a common economic and strategic agenda. Astrategic trilateral between In- dia, Italy and Japan has, in the me- dium to long term, a lot of poten- tial. Their compatible economic systems can create a virtuous and mutually bene†cial contribution to the reorganisation of the global supply chains that is now being re- viewed by many players as a natu- ral result of the Chinese misman- agement of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the security level, the well-de†ned India-Japan Indo- Paci†c partnership can easily be complemented by Italy, already present in the w estern Indian Ocean where it is engaged in anti- piracy operations oš the coast of Somalia. At the multilateral level, the three countries share the same values and the same rules-based world view. Despite these funda- mental convergences, the risk in- herent in missing this opportunity also exists. For this reason, a clear political will is needed from  all sides, and Italy, in particular, should recognise its interests in playing a larger role towards the maintenance of a free and open In- do-Paci†c. Robust India-Italy stra- tegic ties can be the †rst step to- wards the realisation of this goal.  Harsh V.

Forms of discrimination Such incidents are all too common in our society.ﬁSilent segregationﬂ on the grounds of marital status, gender, sexual orientation or eat- ing preferences are followed in several housing societies and resi- dents™ associations. The Housing Discrimination Project (https:// bit.ly/3wvGQFC) at Jindal Global Law School has shown how exten- sive housing discrimination is across the country. The recent Pew Research Cent er Report (https://pewrsr.ch/2TOZF9v) has con†rmed that a substantial num- ber of Indians prefer not to have a person from a dišerent religious community as their neighbour. The absence of a proper legal re- course for those who sušer from housing discrimination only makes matters worse.  Even though Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was read down by the Supreme Court of India to exclude consensual relations bet- ween adults of the same sex, social prejudice against members of the LGBTQIA+ community in the country remains strong. Article 15 (1) of the Constitution of India pro- hibits the state from discriminat- ing against individuals on basis of certain protected characteristics such as religion, race, caste, sex and place of birth. But it does not bar private individuals or institu- tions from doing what the state is not permitted to. Nor does it ex- pressly list ethnicity, linguistic identity, nationality, marital sta- tus, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance and other personal characteristics as prohi- bited grounds of discrimination.  The understanding of discrimi- nation has also evolved over the years. It does not operate along a single axis; it can take the form of combined discrimination which is acombination of discrimination on two or more grounds. Last April, the Supreme Court, in  Patan Jamal Vali vs State of Andhra Pra- desh , recognised intersectional discrimination Š discrimination on the basis of the intersection of personal characteristics, such as that faced by Dalit women as Da- lits, as women and in the unique category of Dalit women. Discrim- inatory practices may also be indi- rect in nature, whereby policies that seem neutral and not express- ly targeted at a particular group, still cause a disproportional ad- verse impact on disadvantaged sections of society. Legal remedies are needed Since discrimination thus operates on a wide variety of grounds, legal remedies are needed for its vic- tims, whether direct, indirect or intersectional. A comprehensive anti-discrimination legal frame- work is required to †ll the existing legal lacunae. India is one of the few liberal democracies without such a framework. The Sachar Committee, in 2006, recogni sed the need for an anti-discrimina- tion law. This was further reiterat- ed by the Expert Group on Equal Opportunity Commission headed by Prof. N.R. Madhava Menon. Though the proposal for an anti- discrimination law was approved by the United Progressive Alliance Cabinet, it was put on the back- burner after the government changed in 2014.  When a Bill lapsed One of us (Tharoor) tried to revive the idea by introducing the Anti- Discrimination and Equality Bill, 2016 (https://bit.ly/3k5KoMf) in the Lok Sabha. Perhaps predicta- bly, the Treasury Benches were not interested to take it forward and the Bill lapsed in 2019 with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha. It seems clear to us that the only way progressive legislation of this na- ture can be passed in the present climate would be if the S tates lead the way, by enacting anti-discrimi- nation laws in their respective ju- risdictions. States have a vital role in strengthening our right to equality. A central Bill cannot, at any rate, cover subjects that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of State governments. And if S tates take the initiative, the demand for anational anti-discrimination law to cover services and institutions under the domain of the Union g o-vernment will be reignited.  Kerala is one the best placed States to take this proposal for- ward, especially since both the major political fronts in the S tate have previously committed them- selves to such legislation. The CPI (M) in its 2019 manifesto (https:// bit.ly/3hVjEet) and the United De- mocratic Front (UDF) in its 2021 State Assembly manifesto (https:// bit.ly/2UGXFjn) have both pro- mised to enact an anti-discrimina- tion law which covers the private and the public sectors. The S tate legislature can use its powers un- der Entry 8 of List III in the S e- venth S chedule to the Constitution to enact an anti-discrimination law that attracts civil penalties for those who engage in discriminato- ry practices.  Crafted for Kerala With the invaluable assistance of Professor Tarunabh Khaitan of Ox- ford University, we have drafted an anti-discrimination Bill for the Kerala g overnment to consider in- troducing in the S tate L egislative Assembly. The Bill prohibits em- ployers, landlords, traders, ser- vice providers, private persons performing public functions, and public authorities, from discrimi- nating on grounds of caste, race, ethnicity, descent, sex, gender identity, gender expression, preg- nancy, sexual orientation, reli- gious identity, tribe, disability, lin- guistic identity, HIV-status, nationality, marital status, dietary preference, skin tone, physical ap- pearance, place of residence, place of birth, age or analogous characteristics which are beyond the control of an individual or those that constitute a fundamen- tal choice.  At the same time, the Bill ba- lances the anti-discrimination mandate with other rights guaran- teed by the Constitution. The anti- discrimination mandate can be restricted in pursuance of a legiti- mate objective:for instance, a dra- ma company putting up a produc- tion of the Ramayana can insist on only male applicants for the role of Ram. That would not be discrimi- nation in the terms covered by the law. The Bill also introduces a“rma- tive-action provisions whereby pu- blic authorities are obliged to pro- gressively realise diversi†cation of their workforces by recruiting members of disadvantaged sec- tions excluded from society, such as transgenderpersons or persons with disabilities. Given the back- logs in our judicial system, the Bill establishes a ‚Kerala Equality Commission™ to adjudicate com- plaints and to provide policy re- commendations to the State g o- vernment. Given that the proliferation of post-retirement public o“ces for judges does not augur well for judicial indepen- dence, the proposed c ommission does not follow the tried and test- ed model of former judges presid- ing over statutory bodies. Rather, appointments to the Commission are left to the political process, with substantial weightage given to the largest parties in the S tate, both in the Treasury and O pposi- tion benches, to ensure bipartisan buy-in to the process. The Bill has been forwarded both to the Law Minister of Kerala and the Leader of the Opposition with the suggestion that it should be subjected to a pre-legislative consultation process, so that de- mocratic participation in enacting this historic law is encouraged (https://bit.ly/3reY74Z). If this Bill is enacted, it will be the largest ex- pansion of civil rights in the S tate since the commencement of the Constitution, and it can be a mo- del for other States to follow. We recognis e that an anti-discrimina- tion law is not a panacea for the problems of inequality and social prejudice that are deeply rooted in our society. Nevertheless, it is a necessary step Š an idea whose time has come. Shashi Tharoor is Member of Parliament for Thiruvananthapuram and an author. Arvind Kurian Abraham is a fellow at the University of Oxford  A Kerala model for an anti-discrimination law If enacted this law will be the largest expansion of civil rights in the State, and can be emulated by the rest of India Shashi Tharoor &  Arvind Kurian Abraham GETTY IMAGES/ISTOCKPHOTO Sport is a distillation of micro-tragedies and mega- ecstasies enmeshed with whirring limbs, glisten- ing sweat, unabashed tears and booming laughter. And football presents a wider canvas for all these attri- butes, which were exhibited at Rio de Janeiro™s Maraca- na Stadium late on Saturday night. When the Copa America †nal that pitted eternal rivals Argentina and Brazil wound to a close, it primarily ošered redemption to Lionel Messi, of the phlegmatic smile and magical feet fame. One of the greatest ever footballers and †t to join a pantheon headlined by Pele and Diego Marado- na, until now Messi had one missing link Š  a cup tri- umph for Argentina. After his 34 summers, that aberra- tion was †nally erased once his team defeated Brazil 1-0 in a scrappy contest with the odd streaks of brillia nce. Messi, miracle-dispenser with FC Barcelona, was seen by his countrymen as the prodigal son, who never deli- vered, and they embalmed for posterity their ašection towards the late Maradona. Messi and his fellow Argen- tines constituted a dysfunctional family of unspoken hurts. All that anguish could dissipate thanks to the lat- est victory which came after a 28-year title drought for the  Albiceleste . Their 15th Copa America trophy put them on a par with toppers Uruguay, well ahead of Bra- zil with nine. Incidentally, Copa America with its 1 916 inception even predates the FIFA World Cup, which commenced in 1930.  Argentina and Brazil have embellished the cham- pionship™s storied history and in South America with its seize-the-day spirit, novels infused with magical rea l- ism and samba dance, football is seen as an extension of aesthetic joy. The †nal though did not live up to that esoteric aim. There were sparks marred by some rough tackles. Messi was not in his elements, marked tightly and weighed down by expectations, he even missed scoring his team™s second goal in the closing minute s. But having drawn the Brazilian defenders towards him all through the game, Messi created spaces that his team-mates could exploit. Even in that missed goal- scoring opportunity, Messi seemed keen on doing an assist rather than performing the deed and this is the mark of a man desperate for ašection from his squad and country. The match was by then †rmly in Argenti- na™s grip thanks to the 22nd minute goal slotted by An- gel Di Maria, who capitalised on a long-pass from Rodri- go De Paul. A stung Brazil, especially Neymar, mounted rapid sorties on either side of half-time. Two attem pts were adroitly foisted by Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and when the  Selecao seemingly breached the citadel, it was deemed oš-side. Argentina and Messi were destined for their shot at glory in a 10-team intra- continental tournament, which despite other simulta- neous global attractions like the Euro and Wimbledon, had its own ešervescent charms.  Silver win Messi needed the Copa America  more than the rest of Argentina Alongside the state and the market, cooperatives play a vital role in the country™s development but  are seldom the focus of policy planning. The creation of a new Union M inistry to oversee the cooper- atives sector will redeem it from negligence, according to the G overnment. Critics fear that this  Ministry is pur- posed to concentrate even more powers in the hands of the Centre. Cooperatives are dominant in agriculture ,credit and marketing, but not limited to  those. Some are big Š IFFCO has around a third of the market share in fertilizers. In milk, cotton, handlooms, housing, edi- ble oils, sugar and †sheries, they are formidable. As market conditions are evolving, cooperatives in  States such as Kerala have got into complex operations: run -ning IT parks and medical colleges. More avenues for expansion, such as insurance, remain untapped and the regulatory regime must evolve in step. The legal ar- chitecture of the sector began evolving since 1904 u n- der  colonial rule, and in 2002, the Multi State  Coopera- tive Societies Act was passed, taking into account  the challenges arising out of liberalisation. Considering the fact that cooperatives fall in the State list of the Consti- tution, the Centre will have to innovate to provide legal sanctity for the new Ministry.A separate Ministry ca nmarshal the dišused capacity of the sector, however. That said, this move will turn disastrous if the at- tempt is to appropriate the political capital of the  sec- tor, which is signi†cant. Cooperatives are not meant to operate by the market logic of maximis ing pro†ts but to share the bene†ts to all stakeholders equitably . Though not uniformacross India, cooperatives have made sig- ni†cant contributions in poverty alleviation, food se- curity, management of natural resources and the envi -ronment. True, the sector has become an instrument of patronage and pilferage. Mismanagement and corrup- tion destroyed the sector in some States. The potenc yof cooperatives as an apparatus of political control is personally known to Minister-in-charge Amit Shah, once president of a d istrict cooperative bank . Besides serving localities and segments that markets might i g- nore, cooperatives are also ešective in mediating polit- ics at the local level, outside of the parliamentary  sys- tem. Despite regulatory oversight by the RBI and States ,there is considerable autonomy for the sector which is often misused. The remedyis not an overarching M inis- try and diktats from Delhi. The premise of a cooperative is that decisions are made by those ašected by them. The case for transparency and e“ciency in the sector is strong; that goal must be pursued not by scaring the ve- ry soul of the sector but by advancing the cooperati ve spirit. The new M inistry could indeed be a catalyst, but it must not fashion itself as a command authority.

One leading merchant pointed out that the normal annual Indian demand was over 3,600 million yards of which the Indian mills supplied about 1,800 million and he did not think their production could be materially increased owing to shortage of looms. He doubted if the educated class would take to Khadi spinning and weaving, but he said it was almost certain that the price of Indian cloth would increase if the fo- reign article was exluded .AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 12, 1921 Boycott campaign World Population Day is marked on July 11 every year to focus attention on the importance  of population-re- lated issues. It was †rst observed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1989 and aims to raise the discourse on sustainable ways to safeguard each life that adds up to a population. As “agged by a UNDP report last year, and subsequently in a global study by  The Lancet , India will stabil- ise its population 12 years earlier than expected. Therefore, the win- dow India has to leverage its ‚demo- graphic dividend™ is narrower than we had thought. Fears of a ‚popula- tion explosion™ are misplaced; in- stead, it is critical that we focus our attention on safeguarding young pe- ople™s well-being because India™s wel- fare hinges on them. Impact of the pandemic At 253 million, India™s adolescent population is among the largest . Ov- er 62% of India is aged between 15 and 59 years, and the median age of the population is less than 30 years. India™s ‚demographic dividend™ re- presents the potential for economic growth based on the age structure of the population. However, transform- ing this potential into reality requires adolescents and the youth to be healthy and well-educated .Even before COVID-19 caused country-wide school closures, India™s underfunded education system was inadequately equipped to provide the skills young people need to take advantage of emerging employment opportunities. According to the World Bank, public expenditure on education constituted 4.4% of GDP in 2019 and only 3.4% of GDP in 2020. Another report revealed that India stands 62nd in terms of public ex- penditure per student, and fares badly in quality of education mea- sures such as student-teacher ratios. Coupled with the impact of CO- VID-19, this paints a bleak picture of the state of education today. In India, more than 32 crore stu- dents have been a‘ected by the na- tionwide lockdown due to COVID-19. Of these, about 15.8 crore are female. The number of schoolgirls who are impacted is 158 million and many of those who have dropped out are un- likely to go back to school. Schools have remained closed even in remote areas where the e‘ect of the pan- demic has been minimal.  Studies show that school closures have a se- rious impact on the lives and mental well-being of children .The impact of the pandemic on adolescents has been severe. A sur- vey by the International Labour Or- ganization reveals that 65%  of adoles- cents worldwide reported having learnt less during the pandemic, and 51%  felt that their learning would be further delayed. It also  highlighted that adolescent mental well-being has taken abig blow, with 17%  of young people likely to be su‘ering from anxiety and depression. It is important, therefore, for poli- cymakers to balance the risks of transmission through  children with the harm of prolonged school clo- sures. By prioritising the vaccination of teachers and school support sta‘ and also allowing a decentralised ap- proach where district-level o’cials may reopen schools based on local COVID-19 transmission rates, schools could be opened in a safe and phased manner. In Odisha, for example, community schools have re-opened in some areas. Students  wear face masks and sit physically distanced from each other outdoors under sheds or tents. With some innovation and creativity, opening schools with amix of online and ošine options could be an important step to ad- dressing the learning needs and mental well-being of adolescents. Increased poverty levels during the pandemic may well have led to a worrying spurt in early marriages of girls in India. As demographers like Shireen Jejeebhoy note, while child marriage as a strategy to address household poverty has been noted in India in general, it has registered an alarming rise during the pandemic. This is linked with increases in gen- der-based violence. Adolescent girls are at high risk during times like these, given their vulnerability to abuse and tra’cking, especially if primary caregivers fall ill or die. Res- tricted mobility due to lockdowns puts girls at risk of violence at home at the hands of caregivers or partn- ers. The impact of the crisis on ado- lescents, especially girls, is of gigan- tic proportions, but the problem is not irredeemable, provided we dis- play †rm commitment to implement- ing quick and e‘ective strategies to overcome the challenges. The way forward We are living through a global crisis and the road ahead is uncertain. This will have long-standing e‘ects on adolescents and youth. Recognising that COVID-19 has a‘ected all dimen- sions of the lives of youth, collabora- tive actions by key ministries, go- vernment agencies, and civil society will be central to developing a holis- tic and meaningful solution. It is im- perative that we have in place me- chanisms for better inter-sectoral collaboration as we move to safe- guard the futures of our adolescents. School mid-day meals, for example, exemplify how improved nutrition bene†ts learning. Not only do they provide an incentive for parents to send their children to school on the assurance of one nutritious meal; they also provide the calorie intake required to stay alert in the class- room. Studies have established strong links between nutrition and cognitive scores among teenagers. Coordination across departments can enable better solutions and grea- ter e’ciencies in tackling the crisis that our adolescents face. Much could be gained if the Minis- try of Education took steps to ensure that adolescents, especially girls, continue their education during the pandemic. Simultaneously, the Mi- nistry of Health and Family Welfare must collaborate with the Education Ministry to disseminate key informa- tion to help adolescents safeguard their health and ability to learn. Given that school closures have impacted access to schemes such as the delivery of menstrual hygiene products to adolescents, teachers can work as volunteers for collabo- rating with frontline health workers to distribute sanitary napkins to girls. To address the mental health of adolescents, the Health and Educa- tion Ministries should strengthen outreach via existing helplines and by enabling conversations on critical issues regarding their reproductive and sexual health. There is enough academic re- search to demonstrate how the de- mographic dividend contributed to growth in other countries, especially during East Asia™s economic miracle of 1965-1990. During that period, East Asia's working age population grew at a faster rate than its depen- dent population, thereby expanding the per capita productivity of these economies. This occurred because East Asian countries developed so- cial, economic, and political institu- tions and policies that allowed them to realise the growth potential creat- ed by the transition. Improving the lives of our adoles- cents in mission mode would lift their lives, but also generate a virtu- ous cycle with healthier and educat- ed young adults contributing sub- stantially to securing India™s future.

There were protest meetings across Tamil Nadu. In one such meeting, a group of young artists came up with numer- ous posters that demanded that the freedom of expression be upheld. After the meeting, I was presented with a set of posters which were based on the poems by the modern Ta- mil poet, Atmanam. These posters adorn my o’ce and constantly remind me not to take free speech for granted. Right to free speech In journalism, we talk about two forms of censorship: one imposed by external forces and the other imposed by us on ourselves due to fear. Though Mr.  Murugan was grant- ed relief by the High Court, legal scholar Gautam Bhatia, in his article ﬁThe fault in our speechﬂ (July 7, 2016), pointed out the limitations in the court™s approach. The judg- ment was based on three rather restrictive arguments: ﬁFirst, that the book has won many prizes, and has gained critical acclaim; second, that Indian culture had always cele- brated sexuality until the Victorian British suppressed it; and third, that read as a whole, the book is not intended to titillate or eroticise, but instead, to make a broader point about how social pressures can impact individual lives.ﬂ Mr. Bhatia rightly argued that ﬁfor speech to be truly free, the judiciary must stop ask- ing literature to justify its aesthetic or its pol- itics before the Bar, whether mediated by an awards jury or notﬂ. Throughout South Asia, writers, poets and journalists often invoke the legendary Faiz Ahmad Faiz to defend our right to express ourselves fully. His poetry ‚Bol (Speak)™ galvanised many for decades to †ght for the fundamental right to free speech. He wrote: ﬁSpeak, for your lips are free; speak, for your tongue is still yours. Your upright body belongs to you; speak, for your soul still is yoursﬂ. What unites a legal mind like Mr. Bhatia and a cultural icon like Mr. Faiz is their un- ending quest to secure rights for everyone. Mr. Faiz wrote the Report of the 1968 Stand- ing Committee on Art and Culture, which was forgotten not only in Pakistan but across South Asia. It is important for courts and the governments to listen to Mr. Faiz. He wrote: ﬁCulture is lived and evolved by the whole community– The arts are not a luxury. They are an important factor in a nation™s mental and moral health and productive e’ciency.ﬂ There is a body of literature about free- dom of expression and freedom of the press. Such works talk about the excesses of go- vernments and the legal recourse. But there are no clues in literature on how to deal with agovernment which makes its decisions in total secrecy. James Madison, author of the Bill of Rights in the U.S., once said that ﬁa popular government without popular infor- mation or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to farce or a tragedy or perhaps bothﬂ. In India, now there is very little cred- ible popular information. Journalists are forced to rely on sources and form an opi- nion based on conjectures. O†cial silence On July 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ef- fected a major reshuše in his Cabinet. Beyond headline management by the go- vernment, citizens know very little about the factors that led to this change. The strap line that accompanied the reshuše story on the front page of this newspaper read: ﬁMove aimed at bringing in quali†ed professionals and balancing regional and community aspi- rations in the run-up to upcoming electionsﬂ. Iwas intrigued by two sentences in the story. One read: ﬁGovernment sources termed it an e‘ort by Mr. Modi to strike a ba- lance between political messaging of includ- ing MPs from various regional centres as well as from marginalised communities and beef- ing up the skill set of the ministries with pro- fessionally and educationally quali†ed addi- tions.ﬂ And the other said: ﬁSeveral ministries have been clubbed together, sources say, to increase synergy.ﬂ Why should journalists rely on sources for such perfectly legitimate and democratically valid reasons? Why was there no o’cial brie†ng? Journalists are forced to cite sources because of the o’cial silence. How do we address this important democratic de†cit? The go- vernment is aware that secrecy is a potent weapon. It is no longer a prologue to farce or tragedy. It is tragedy. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in Secrecy is a weapon Journalists are forced to rely on sources and form an opinion based on conjectures A.S.

This unprecedented health crisis has also severely impact- ed the gains made in the education sector over the last few years. In In- dia alone, 1.5 million schools shut down in 2020, a‘ecting 320 million learners and impacting their educa- tion, protection and well-being. Throughout this pandemic, the ex- ceptional e‘ort undertaken by teach- ers  must be highlighted. Using the re- sources available to them, Indian teachers mobilised as one and have remained on the front-lines of educa- tion to ensure continuity of learning, often against formidable odds,  even though the pandemic claimed the lives of many of them. As the country steps up its e‘orts to tackle the devastating e‘ects of the second wave of COVID-19, the nation- al vaccination campaign has as- sumed greater importance than ever before, so that we can †nally move to a‚new normal™. There is an urgent need to better recognise teachers as front-line workers and prioritise them in the vaccination campaign. While this has already been done by many State governments, the mo- del should be replicated nationwide. This will not only speed up the reo- pening of schools so that students can get back to ‚in person™ learning, but will also provide safety .Barriers to vaccination Mass vaccination campaigns do not solely depend on the availability of vaccines. Such e‘orts are always hin- dered by a lack of suitable transport facilities, and di’cult or prolonged travel time to the vaccination sites. Teachers, like anyone else, may be worried about travelling long dis- tances to the vaccination centres for fear of contracting the virus on pu- blic transport and may not be able to access other means of conveyance. Keeping these limitations in mind and to support the process of swift vaccination for teachers initiated by the government, the ride-sharing company Uber and UNESCO are coming together to o‘er a ‚Free rides for teachers™ vaccination™ campaign to provide  teachers with the means to travel to the vaccination centres in asafe manner while o‘setting the costs of traveling long distances. The initiative o‘ers 1,00,000 rides to 25,000 teachers to and from vacci- nation centres to get the two vaccine doses. The o‘er will be implemented in Chennai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi- rapalli in Tamil Nadu. The rides will be made available via a promotional code communicated to the teachers with a detailed pictorial brochure to help them download the application and use the code. Global partnerships The impact of the pandemic across the globe necessitates a coordinated response. Last year, UNESCO launched the Global Education Coali- tion (GEC), a platform for collabora- tion to protect the right to education during the pandemic and beyond. The coalition brings together more than 175 members from the UN fami- ly, civil society, academia, and the private sector focusing on three key issues, namely connectivity, teach- ers, and gender to ensure continuous access to education for all. As we now begin to re-imagine education in a post-COVID-19 world, we must remember that renewed cooperation between governments and the private sector can go a long way in combating this crisis . Through our partnership with Uber, we wish to acknowledge the continued com- mitment of teachers to their students and their critical role in contributing to the achievement of the 2030 tar- gets under Sustainable Development Goal 4.  In this crisis, teachers have shown great leadership and innovation in ensuring that #LearningNeverStops, and that no learner is left behind. They have also helped in communi- cating measures that prevent the spread of the virus and providing as- sistance to ensure the mental well- being of all children. An accelerated vaccination process will enable them to stand fully ready when schools reopen.Eric Falt is the Director and Representative  of the UNESCO New Delhi Cluster O†ce covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka A ride to safety Uber and UNESCO are coming together to o†er a ‚Free rides for teachers™ vaccination™ campaign Eric Falt Mr. Jaya Prakash Narayan, Mr. Sadaq Ali, Pre- sident of the Congress (O), Mr. Krishna Me- nen and other leading politicians continue to call for the immediate recognition of Ban- gla Desh. The demand has also been pressed by some members in the Lok Sabha and the Jan Sangh plans to take the issue to the streets next month. Though the Govern- ment™s sympathies are fully with the Bangla Desh movement there are good reasons for not according diplomatic recognition at this stage. There would be little point in that re- cognition unless it can be followed up with massive supply of arms to the freedom †ght- ers. This would be treated as an act of war by Pakistan and provide grist for Pakistan™s pro- paganda mill which has been trying to tell the world that India promoted a seccession- ist movement in East Pakistan and that the Awami League is a pro-Indian party. Pakistan would probably welcome any sign of Indian intervention in the east, and if black-out exercises are being held in New Delhi and troops put on the alert in Kashmir, it is because India fears that Islamabad may provoke a war at any moment, just to make it appear that India has engineered the Ban- gla Desh struggle to weaken Pakistan.
