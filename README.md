The only wy to ttle the novel coronvirus is through complete vccintion . With lockdowns eing lifted, nd the thret of  third wve looming lrge in the ckdrop of new vrints, is Indi relly prepred?  Iflessons hve not een lernt from the trgic ftermth of the second wve, then it is cler tht we, s  ntion, hve not lernt nything. In the months hed, which will e mrked y  series of festive events, llout e†orts re required  to ensure tht the sitution does not get out of hnd.  Blsurmnim Pvni, Secunderd nVisuls of the su†ering during the second wve  re still fresh in our minds.  TheStte nd centrl governments should do their it in ensuring tht COVID19 pproprite ehviour is the norm. The penlties for violtions cn help to chnge the sitution to some extent. The Stte of Uttrkhnd hs done well to cncel the Knwr Ytr, which would hve een nother super spreder event. All types of gtherings should e curtiled y the uthorities for t lest six months.

The re ferendum domintes British polit ics s the most signi‘cnt event since the Second World Wr , re sulting in two generl elections, ousting two premiers nd thre tening the politicl geogrphy of the U.K. Loose ends British Prime Minister Boris John son needed  rpid deprture from the Europen Union (E U), nd the Withdrwl nd Trde nd Coopertion Agreements of De cemer 2020 were rushed through. Prolems were soon p prent. The U.K. imports 70%  of the ‘sh it consumes; the industry only contriutes 0.12% of GDP nd employs 0.1%of the workforce (https://it.ly/3i7emwG), ut hs politicl trction. In My, fter 60 French ‘shing ots mssed to lockde Jersey over ‘shing rights, nvl units from oth Britin nd Frnce deployed o† Jersey,  frci cl reminder of the loose ends of Britin™s exit from the EU. Cse of Northern Irelnd Northern Irelnd, prt of the U.K. ut in the E U™s single mrket, nd therefore oliged to follow E Urules, is nother cse in point. The EU™s externl order would e in the Irish Se etween Britin nd Northern Irelnd, nd goods for Northern Irelnd would need to e inspected there, which is politi clly untenle for the U.K . The l terntive would e tht the E Uwould itself impose inspections to protect its single mrket nd struc ture  order either on the islnd of Irelnd or etween Irelnd nd the E U, which re oth eqully unfesile. Tensions predictly rose et ween Britin nd the E Uover the import of chilled met products from Britin to Northern Irelnd, with Britin seeking n extension of the trnsition rrngements from June 30 y three months. No one elieves tht this cn e  lst ing solution. It  seems Britin is questioning Brexit greements rther thn following them, while osting out its COVID19 immu nis tion compred to the E Und the success of the City of London in mintining its sttus ginst hostile E Ulegisltion nd incen tives for nks to move to Euro pen cpitls. To supporters of Brexit, it looked s if the E Uwnt ed to punish Britin for leving, if only to discourge its other mem ers from doing the sme. Thus, fter memership of the E Ufor l most 50 yers, mutul trust is lck ing, nd two versions of  rules sed order re colliding. This ws pprent during the G7 summit, when ilterl meetings etween Mr. Johnson nd E Uleders lcked wrmth. The E Uconceded the Northern Irelnd postponement nd persuded its memer S ttes, especilly Frnce nd Germny tht re losing ptience with Bri tin, to void  trde wr over Brit ish susges. Such recrimintions my ecome  permnent feture of U.K.E Ureltions s  smll n tion plys  poor hnd ginst the world™s lrgest trding loc while seeking trde dels with distnt countries, which even o“cil fore csts suggest will produce negligi le ene‘ts. Scotlnd™s clcultions In Scotlnd, the Ntionl Prty, which seeks n exit from the U.K., hs grown in populrity since the Brexit vote. Scots voted in the refe rendum y 62% ginst 38%to re min in the E U, ut were drgged out y the overll result. For mny Scots, leving the U.K. is the cler est pth ck to the E U, nd ntici pte tht mong other ene‘ts, the E Uwill grnt Scotlnd lest de veloped sttus nd suventions on the scle enjoyed y the Irish Re pulic. This is s much n nti Westminster stnce s n e†ort to join the E Usince the chnces of n independent Scotlnd jumping the queue of E Upplicnts nd of ll memer Sttes pproving Scot tish memership re not gret. Ne vertheless, the prospect of  rekup of the United Kingdom is of grve concern to London. Menwhile,  vote on re uni‘ction in Irelnd seems more prole now thn t ny time since the Good Fridy Agreement of 1998 which rought n unesy pece to frtricidl fctions in the North. In perspective The Interntionl Monetry Fund wrned tht the British economy fced  10% GDP decline in 2020 (https://it.ly/3rZXUs) In ‘rst qurter 2021, food nd drink ex ports to the E Udeclined y nerly 50% (https://it.ly/3yUvj41) nd export of services lso shrnk. At lest 500British compnies hve relocted to Europe (https:// it.ly/3ejG746). The Brexiteers who forecst  clen rek with the EU either underestimted or ignored the prcticl inconve niences of leving, including the vst pperwork involved in ex porting nd importing with the EU, ut the success of British CO VID19 vccintion compred with the E U™s ungled e†orts hs en led Brexiteers to clw ck some ground.  In sum, most people hve c cepted Brexit though  few re stis ‘ed with the divorce settlement. No version of Brexit will stisfy everyone, nd it hs left the United Kingdom less united.

To chieve this, the go vernment sys it will consider the enctment of  new piece of legis ltion. One such lw tht might e on the nvil is n ominous propo sl relesed just dys erlier y the Stte™s Lw C ommission (https://it.ly/3xGH2TF). Incentives nd disincentives This drft lw, titled the Uttr Pr desh Popultion (Control, Stili stion nd Welfre) Bill, 2021, seeks to provide not only  series of incentives to fmilies tht dh ere to  twochild norm, ut lso intends on disentitling fmilies tht rech the norm from ene ‘ts nd susidies. These recom mendtions re rooted in  culture of coercion. They re lso steeped in myth. Experiences from cross the world demonstrte tht lws of this kind simply do not work. They invrily instil n ttitude of dis crimintion, with  urden im posed disprtely on the most vul nerle groups in society. The drft B ill echoes the U.P. go vernment™s new policy in climing tht the Stte™s ecologicl nd eco nomic resources re limited. Ac cording to it, unless popultion growth is regulted, the S tte will e unle to gurntee the provi sion of sic rights to ll citizens. It lso invokes some of the now usul uzzwords: sustinle de velopment, it sys, cnnot e chieved without governmentim posed irthcontrol.  To these ends, the drft postu ltes n rry of mesures. It pro mises pulic servnts who under go sterilistion nd dopt  twochild norm severl ene‘ts. These include two increments during their service, susidy to wrds the purchse of  house, mternity, or pternity leve, with full slry nd llownces, s the cse my e, for up to 12 months, nd free helth cre nd insurnce coverge for the spouse. This is s fr s the ﬁincentivesﬂ go. The drft Bill lso contins  list of punishments. It terms these euphemisticlly s ﬁdisincen tives ﬂ. A person who reches the twochild norm will e derred from securing the ene‘t of ny governmentsponsored welfre scheme nd will e disquli‘ed from pplying to  ny Stte govern ment jo. Existing government employees who infringe the rule will e denied the ene‘t of pro motion. And lst, trnsgressing in dividuls will e prohiited from contesting elections to locl uth orities nd odies. Itis worth pondering over whether regultion of popultion is necessry t ll. But ssuming such regultion is  legitimte go vernmentl im, the ‘rst question tht we must sk of the new propo sl is: why. After ll, experiences from other S ttes in Indi show us tht there re more e“ccious nd lterntive mesures ville to control the growth of popultion, including processes imed t im proving pulic helth nd ccess to eduction.  Indeed, the Union Ministry of Helth nd Fmily Welfre con ceded s much efore the Su preme Court lte lst yer. Through n “dvit ‘led in court, the centrl government rgued tht ﬁinterntionl experience shows tht ny coercion to hve  certin numer of children is counterproductive nd leds to demogrphic distortionsﬂ. The Government further con‘rmed tht Indi ws committed to its oligtions under interntionl lw, including the principles con tined in the  Interntionl Confe rence on Popultion nd Develop ment Progrmme of Action, 1994.  Pledge on right Foremost in those principles ws  pledge from ntions tht they would look eyond demogrphic trgets nd focus insted on gu rnteeing  right to reproductive freedom. Since then, in Indi, the Supreme Court of Indi hs recog nised this right s n inlienle promise. In  Suchit Srivstv & Anr vs Chndigrh Administrtion (2009), the Court found tht  wo mn™s freedom to mke reproduc tive decisions is n integrl fcet of the right to personl lierty gu rnteed y Article 21. ﬁIt is impor tnt,ﬂ the Court wrote, ﬁto recog nise tht reproductive choices cn e exercised to procrete s well s to stin from procretingﬂ. This ruling ws endorsed y the Supreme Court™s ninejudge Bench verdict in  K.S. Puttswmy vs Union of Indi (2017). A reding of the plurlity of opinions there shows us tht the Constitution sees  person™s utonomy over her ody s n extension of the right to privcy. In his judgment, Justice D.Y. Chndrchud held tht priv cy prtkes di†erent connot tions. These include decisionl u tonomy, which comprehends, mong other things, lierty over ﬁintimte personl choices such s those governing reproductionﬂ. Justice S.K. Kul similrly declred in his seprte judgment tht the right to procretion ws n impor tnt constituent of ﬁthe privcy of the homeﬂ.  Like ll other fundmentl rights, the right to privcy is not oundless. But, s  Puttswmy clri‘es, ny restriction plced on the right must conform to  doc trine of proportionlity. This re quires ‘rst, tht the limittion e rooted in sttute; second, tht the stte show us tht the ojective of its lw is founded on  legitimte governmentl im; third tht there re no lterntive nd less intru sive mesures ville to chieve the sme ojective; nd fourth, tht there exists  rtionl connec tion etween the limittion im posed nd the ims of the sttute. The logic here is simple: in pursu ing pulic interest, it is essentil tht governments ensure tht indi vidul lierties re encroched upon to the lowest degree possi le. A simple reding of U.P.™s drft lw will show us tht, if encted, it will grossly impinge on the right to reproductive freedom. The go vernment will likely rgue tht there is no violtion of privcy here ecuse ny decision on ste rilistion would e voluntry. But, s we ought to y now know, mk ing welfre conditionl is  hll mrk of coercion. If we wnt the ide of Indi s  welfre stte to men something, the right to c cess sic goods cnnot e mde provisionl on  person scri‘cing her odily utonomy. By ll ccounts, therefore, the proposed lw will fll foul of  pro portionlity nlysis. If nothing else, the Union government™s con cession in the Supreme Court de monstrtes tht there re severl lterntive, lessintrusive mens ville to regulte popultion.  Negtive consequences But the new proposl is lso wor rying ecuse it is likely to ring with it  host of other deleterious consequences.  For instnce, n lredy skewed sex rtio my e compounded y fmilies orting  dughter in the hope of hving  son with  view to conforming to the twochild norm. The lw could lso led to  prolifertion in sterilistion cmps,  prctice tht the Su preme Court hs previously depre cted. In  Devik Bisws vsUnion of Indi (2016), the Court pointed to how these cmps invrily hve  disprte impct on minorities nd other vulnerle groups.  As is so often the cse with d lws in Indi, though, this drft B illmy ‘nd support from some pst judgments of the Supreme Court. In this cse, the G overnment my point to the judgment in  Jved & Ors vs Stte of Hryn & Ors (2003), where the C ourt upheld  lw tht disquli‘ed persons with more thn two children from con testing in locl ody elections. But not only is the present proposl fr more disproportionte Š in tht it virtully snctions civil deth for those tht violte the norms it ‘xes Š the judgment in Jved cn no longer e seen s good lw. For one thing, its resoning ’ies in the fce of  Puttswmy . But s rousing s the ninejudge B ench verdict is, its legcy depends on how its ‘ndings re pplied. For the judgment to hve tngile v lue nd mening, ny lw of this kind, which invdes upon our most personl nd ethicl choices, must e seen s repugnnt to the Constitution.Suhrith Prthsrthy is n dvocte prctising t the Mdrs High Court Mking welfre conditionl is  stmp of coercion Asimple reding of U.P.™s drft popultion control lw is thtit will grossly impinge on the right to reproductiv e freedom Suhrith Prthsrthy  GETTY IMAGES/ISTOCKPHOTO Less thn  month fter the Centre revised its vcci ntion policy nd took over the responsiility of vccine procurement from the S ttes, old worries of  supply constrint pper to hve resurfced.

Beginning this week, the dily doses hve gin slipped to 30 40 lkh though this is etter thn in My when Indi strug gled to provide even 20 lkh doses  dy. There re two mjor concerns with the slckening pce. One, Indi still hs mnged to inoculte only 33% of its dult popultion with t lest one dose;  just out 8%hve een fully vccinted. At this rte, it  is impossile for the Centre to deliver on its stted gol of inoculting ll Indin dults y the yer end. Second ,the signs re pprent everywhere of n uptick in cses. The U.S. Š the only country with more cses thn Indi Šfter  month of reporting less thn 15,000 cses  dy is now, like Indi, seeing over 40,000 cses  dy .There hs lso een  rise there in dily deths.

The pex court hd in Ferury overruled Mr. Oli™s decision to dissolve the House in Decemer 2020 s well. But thi stime, the ruling ws more thn just  rp on his knuck les .

The ‘vememer Constitutionl Bench lso provided the wy out of the unending politicl de dlock in the House y llowing individul lwmkers to ignore their prty whips during  trust vote tht is  must win for Mr. Deu. The inility of Mr. Oli nd Mr. Deu to win trust votes, prior to the dissolution deci sion y Ms. Bhndri, ws ecuse  the support for them  in the 275memer House divided oth the ruling Communist Prty of Nepl (Uni‘ed MrxistLeninist) (UML) nd the O pposition Jnt Smjwdi Prty (JSP) s reel lwmkers risked suspension.

THURSDAY,JULY15,2021 7OPEDWe hve received  copy of the hndook on the eduction of Depressed clsses in My sore pulished y the InspectorGenerl of eduction in the Stte. The ook is intended to serve s  guide to deprtmentl o†cers nd to others who re interested in the ques tion. The theory tht the verge Depressed clss oy is inherently ckwrd in receiving eduction is refuted s  mere “ction nd the rgument is dvnced tht given the ne cessry help, sympthy, opportunity nd the specil hndling tht is essentil in view of the ges of enforced illitercy through which he hs pssed, he cn successfully compete with the rest in the end. ﬁWht is necessry is to wken him from his lethrgy so fr s eduction is concerned, wen him from the evil hits tht re more often the e‘ects rther thn cuses of his degrd tion, nd rise him from the mentl depen dency to which hs hs sunk for wnt of op portunity nd encourgement for genertions, in short to give him  morl nd mentl tone in keeping with the physicl tht is in him nd to get him to fce life with fith in himself nd his future.ﬂ AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 15, 1921 Eduction of Depressed clsses. The llprty conference on Jmmu nd Kshmir (J&K) reveled the fi lure of the strtegy crfted y the Go vernment of Indi. The Bhrtiy J nt Prty (BJP) hs long urged the rogtion of Article 370 of the Con stitution. But the constitutionl coup went miles eyond tht. It rogted Article 35A s well, roke up the Stte of J&K  y lopping o‘ Ldkh, nd reduced the rest to  Union Ter ritory. It is unthinkle tht ny oth er Stte would hve received the tretment meted out to J&K  whose ‚specil sttus™ ws n eyesore. But the elephnt in the room ws the lw on delimittion of the consti tuencies. It trumpeted the rel oject of the coup loud nd cler, which ws to wipe out the politicl setup in J&K nd estlish  new politicl or der. To ccomplish this, virtully the entire politicl clss of Kshmir hd to e put out of ction, the press muzzled, ssemlies nned, tou rists given mrching orders, schools nd colleges shut, nd electronic communictions suspended. Arogtion of Article 370 Article 370 cnnot e rogted even y Prliment, let lone y the Presi dent. Even the letter of Article 370 rs tht. But there is  profound re son which fundmentlly rs such  result. To cite n exmple, insurgen cy erupted in Mizorm on Ferury 28, 1966. The Mizo Ntionl Front (MNF) led y Lldeng egn n rmed insurgency nd declred in dependence the next dy. On June 30, 1986,  the Mizorm Accord ws signed. It sid: ﬁNotwithstnding nything contined in the Constitu tion, no Act of Prliment in respect of () Religion or socil prctices of the Mizos, () Mizo customry lw or procedure, (c) Administrtion of civil nd criminl justice involving deci sions ccording to Mizo customry lw, (d) Ownership nd trnsfer of lnd, shll pply to the Stte of Mizo rm unless the Legisltive Assemly of Mizorm y  resolution so de cides.ﬂ On Ferury 20, 1987, the 53rd Constitution Amendment cme into force inserting Article 371G which reds thus: ﬁNotwithstnding nything in this Constitution, no Act of Prliment in respect of (i) Reli gious or socil prctices of the Mizos, (ii) Mizo customry lw nd proce dure, (iii) Administrtion of civil nd criminl justice involving decisions ccording to Mizo customry lw, (iv) Ownership nd trnsfer of lnd, shll pply to the Stte of Mizorm unless the Legisltive Assemly of Mizorm y  resolution so decides.ﬂ The two re identiclly worded ecuse Article 371G gives legl force to n ccord etween the Union nd the MNF. Prliment cnnot repel it or even mend it unilterlly.  Article 370 stnds on  higher foot ing. It gives legl force to n ccord etween the Union nd  Stte of the Union nd the prleys were held y Prime Minister Jwhrll Nehru nd his deputy, Srdr Vllhhi Ptel. They egn t Ptel™s  residence on My 15, 1949 nd ended in midOc toer with n greed text. But it ws moved in n ltered form in the Con stituent Assemly on Octoer 17, 1949 y N. Goplswmi Ayyngr in the sence of Sheikh Adullh who hppened to e in the loy. He rushed to the House. Article 370 mde Kshmir™s Con stituent Assemly the sole uthority to ccord consent to ny ddition to the Centre™s power nd to further ex tension  to Kshmir of Indi™s Consti tution. The Assemly “rst met on Oc toer 31, 1951 nd ws formlly dissolved on Novemer 17, 1956.

This osession with strology is not  new phenomenon in  country which recently sent  spcecrft in orit round  Mrs. A si milr decision ws tken y the Atl Bihri Vjpyee government in 2001, which ws withdrwn fter widespred opposition. In this context, ll the citizens of this country who re concerned out the sttus of eduction nd the role of scienti“c tempe rment in eduction need to tke  stnce out this deci sion.  Content of syllus Let us strt y exmining wht is covered y the  IGNOU syllus. Even  csul look t the syllus gives us n understnding of  the unscienti“c nture of the course. The syllus includes the study of horoscopes, which re determined y  thestte of di‘erent plnets t the time of our irth nd which pprently impct ll the things tht we do throughout our life. It lso includes how to decide on n uspicious time for inititing  speci“c tsk. It  clims to trin its students in how to nullify the ill ef fects occurring due to speci“c prolems in their horoscope. The rnge of prolems for which strology cn o‘er solutions hs no  limit. It provides solutions on when  one needs to pply for  jo to ensure  good result to even determining the time  ntion hs to tke  decision to strt  wr!  Let us try nd evlute the three sic s sumptions of strology on which this syll us is sed. The “rst ssumption is tht the plnets round us in the universe hve  con tinuous e‘ect on humn life. The second s sumption is tht the result depends on the time of irth of the person nd the third s sumption is tht the future of  person de pends on ll this nd cn e chnged y solu tions o‘ered y n strologer. Let us now look t the min ojections y stronomy (the science of the universe) to these ssumptions. As per strology, nine Nvgrhs ‘ect our lives. All of us know tht four of these  Nvgrhs re not even grhs (plnets). The sun is not  plnet ut str. The moon is the nturl stellite of the erth. Rhu nd Ketu, which re climed to e the most dngerous plnets in strology, re not even plnets ut points of intersec tion of the pths of the sun nd the moon .The Milky Wy, in which the sun nd solr system re included, hs countless  strs oth er thn the sun. It is not very di†cult to p precite how unscienti“c nd potentilly dngerous it will e to llow something like strology s  minstrem course. Next, let us look t  the time of irth. The nture of  horoscope is dependent on the time of one™s irth. And the time of irth used for this purpose y strology is the time when the y tkes the “rst reth outside the mother™s wom. Modern science tells us tht the y is ctully orn when the sperm nd ovum come together to form the emryo, nd it grows for the next nine months through di‘erent stges. How do ll these  Nvgrhs  not hve ny impct on the y when it is inside the mother™s wom nd strt ‘ecting it only when it comes out? Astrologers hve no nswer. It is  simple o servtion tht thousnds of chil dren re orn in the world every second nd their futures re not the sme. Wht will e in their ho roscope when  humn eing gives irth to  y, sy, on the moon or Mrs tomorrow? The most serious e‘ect of depending on s trology is tht it tkes  humn gency out of our lives .Science nd pseudoscience While we re on the pth to strology, Elon Musk, n Americn usinessmn, hs strt ed  project to humnise Mrs under the SpceX mission. The rootic rovers sent y NASA to Mrs re collecting informtion nd sending it ck to erth.  Stephen Hwking stted tht the serch for  hitle plnet like erth in the universe should e the prior ity of stronomicl reserch. Aginst this ckground, one needs to lern to di‘eren tite etween strology, which is  pseudo science, nd strophysics, which is  roust scienti“c discipline. Astrology exploits the vulnerility of the humn mind while peo ple fce  uncertinty. On the other hnd, s trophysics depends on the core scienti“c principles of precise oservtions, hypothe sis, experimenttion nd results sed on ll these. In n er where pseudoscience hs strted ecoming the new norml, it™s our responsiility s citizens to oppose such de cisions nd demnd the withdrwl of such  course. Hmid Dholkr is  psychitrist nd memer of the rtionlist movement, Mhrshtr Andhshrddh Nirmuln Smiti No pseudoscience, plese Astrology exploits the vulnerility of the humn mind nd should not e tught s  minstrem course y universities Hmid Dholkr CC CCDATA POINT The Delhi Chief Minister  recently wrote to Prime Minister Nrendr Modi urging him to consider wrd ing n ﬁIndin Doctorﬂ the  Bhrt Rtn, the country™s highest civilin honour. ﬁBy n ‚Indin doctor™, I men the entire medicl community Šll doctors, nurses nd prmedics should e given the wrd, collective ly,ﬂ he wrote.  He requested the Prime Minister to chnge the rules if the current rules do not permit confer ment on ny group s such. While this is  gret gesture, chnging the rules would open  Pn dor™s ox  nd erse the snctity t tched to this prestigious wrd. There is no dout tht doctors need to e honouredfor their relentless nd dedicted service during the pndemic. But there were mny  who lso ’eeced  ptients nd the kin of the decesed y  exploiting their helplessness nd despertion . Mny privte hospitls chrged exoritnt mounts for tretment. Should these plunderers lso e grouped with those who worked sel’essly nd e prt of the honour?  Pying compenstion Rther thn eulogising their  services, the Chief Minister could hve t lest ensured tht the doctors nd nurses were pid their slries on time. Sev erl doctors nd nurses went on strike ecuse they were not pid. According to the Indin Medicl As socition, 798 doctors died in the se cond wve. With Delhi recording the highest numer of such ftlities (128 doctors), the Chief Minister should hve pid n ex grti mount of š1 crore to ech of them . The Delhi go vernment hd, in April 2020, n nounced š1 crore in ex grti for fmi lies of frontline workers who die of the infection while on duty. But most of the fmilies of the doctors hve not een pid. Nor hve the kin of police men who died of the infection while on duty.  The wife of  decesed con stle knocked on the doors of Delhi High Court climing the promised mount. The hering is scheduled for July 28. While doctors nd prmedics rendered yeomn service during the pndemic, other frontline workers, including the police, too contriuted t grve risk to their lives.  Menwhile, while the locl courts in New Delhi hve reprimnded the Delhi Police for their hndling of the riots nd “ned them š25,000 for mis hndling of cses relted to the riots, 25 personnel of the Delhi Police hve stked their clim for the President™s Police Medl for Gllntry, citing their role in the Delhi riots lst yer. Among them is the then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ved Prksh Sury, who ws seen stnding next to BJP leder Kpil Mishr when Mr. Mishr ws delivering  controversil speech  dy efore the riots roke out. Even the Joint Commissioner of Police hs entered the fry. Choosing the wrdees Every individul will  exggerte his role in the riots to stke his clim. Much would depend on the projec tion of the individul™s role in  mn ner tht would e convincing enough to consider the cse for wrd of  medl. In such rigmrole, the possi ility of the wrong persons getting wrded cnnot e ruled out. The deserving ones who re left out get demorlised nd shy wy from ex posing themselves to risk. According to  senior o†cil of Delhi Police,  highpowered com mittee of senior o†cils goes through every cse thoroughly. Depending on the degree of rvery displyed y ech,  few re recommended for the gllntry medls while others re re commended for the Police Commis sioner™s Commendtion Disc.
