CMYKNDX DELHITHE HINDU MagazineSunday,July11,2021 02OPEN PAGE How many recipes have most of us seen with the instruc tion ﬁsalt to tasteﬂ? Perhaps, in all.  Students in my cookery classes would ask what and how much does salt to taste mean. I would wonder what explanation to give.  How come when I attended cook ery classes, researched standar dised recipes and wrote them out, I used this phrase without a second thought?  Ihad this explanation: an expe rienced cook knows her salt. It™s on ly when teaching a novice that the instruction should be clear.  Now, let me come to a further analysis of the instruction, which is so easily, frequently and carelessly used.  F rom the sea From the physiological point of view, salt is an essential ingredient in food. Are there more than one va riety of salt? Yes, there are. Nowa days, recipes speci†cally mention sea salt, while in the early days, sea water was the only source of salt, harvested from salt pans. This salt will be in clumps and cleaned to get rock salt, the basic stu“. This can be powdered for various needs.  Later, chemically produced sodi um chloride as a †ne powder be came available, which is now more commonly used. Himalayan mineral salt is supposed to be a natural salt and is now getting popular.  In the 1980s, the government suddenly woke up to iodine de† ciency in the population and made it mandatory to sell only iodinefor ti†ed salt. Dietitians and the medical fraternity came out against it, and hence some leniency has been res tored .  Ishould also tell you that ﬁsalti nessﬂ of each salt varies.  Next, I come to the second part of the phrase, ﬁto tasteﬂ.  To whose taste? Should we say, each one to his own taste? We know that tastes di“er, and how! For an in dividual, the taste can be his or her own. When cooking for a larger group, the taste has to be universal. It is safe to keep to lower levels and allow people to add salt at the table. Hence the term ﬁtable saltﬂ per haps, as it should be a †ne powder to mix easily with the cooked food. Further, people of di“erent health conditions may need less or more salt. For example, patients with hy pertension require less. But still how much is salt to taste? Actually, I have no de†nite answer. I would say, ﬁDivide the dish into four imaginary portions, sprin kle a little salt into each portion, mix well, cook for a few minutes, mix well again and taste a spoon of the dish, then add a little more, if re quired. That is to your taste. ........................................................................m alathimohan00@yahoo.com Worth its salt The nuances of the essential ingredient M alathi Mohan  This page consists of reader submissions.

The mission was simple: eat as many varieties of mangoes till the end of the season. With the lock down restricting my choices, I decid ed to order online and get the fruits homedelivered. One may ask, why mangoes? Why not the evergreen bananas or the jui cy watermelons? For that, I retort, ﬁWhy is the ‚snitch™ popular in  Harry Potter or why is the ‚Mockingjay pin™ popular from  Hunger Games ? Why have these items been begged, borrowed, bought and googled? While some may point to good marketing, others call it nostalgia. The cherished memory of sum mers from my early childhood is about lying under the shade of a huge mango tree in my grandmoth er™s ancestral house. The ninecham bered house had enough room for me, but under the mango tree, I found my home. In the warm breeze, the aroma of the Totapuri mangoes, turning a shade darker by the day, would †ll my vision and heart. Though they are not the sweetest mangoes, they burst to life with taste when added to asalad or pickled. During those summers, my broth ers and I would volunteer to help the adults in plucking the mangoes from the trees. We would always hide a couple of parrotnosed Totapuri un der mounds of Neelum mangoes from the neighbouring †elds. Sup pressed smiles would emerge when the elders o“ered a jar of the home made Neelum mango pickle to our neighbours. I am famous for once laying my hands on the mango bas kets and leaving bite marks all over the reddish Payri mangoes that marked the beginning of summer, only to be bellowed at for ruining the whole lot. Even after being banished to my room, I would feel a warm feeling in my heart as the smell of the †breless Dasheri mangoes wafted through the cracks of my door. The Nawabs had grown this variety, and the aro ma of this mango certainly makes one feel like royalty. The trick is to al ways balance the extreme sweetness of this particular mango with a bite of its greenish skin to cleanse the palate. Every basket that arrived from my great uncle™s yard from Ahmedabad would have mangoes with a distinct red crown. Alphonso, the king of all mangoes, they called it. On late af ternoons, when others slumbered, my diabetic grandmother would sneak behind the creaking steps of the attic and bite into the luscious Al phonsos with the golden juice trick ling down her hands. To every wo man, her Alphonso, I would claim and secure this secret in the depths of the attic. The attic itself was the ministry of mangoes. The last mango to arrive, the Chausa, named by Sher Shah Suri after his defeat of Humay un, would be preserved at the top of the lot to save the fruits as long as time would permit. Today, in my brickwalled house on the 12th ‘oor of an apartment building overlooking another brick wall, the only thing I got after seven days of wait was a lone Himsagar. Be ing the rebel it is, the mango has a thin skin that permits its aroma to enter every nook and crannies of my apartment. With nearly 1,500 varie ties of mangoes to taste, I decide to take things into my hands and get ready to chase the vendor down the road for my next mango. ........................................................................s indujakrishnakumar1995@gmail.com The summer mango hunt Despite the wide variety of the fruit, one can™t have enough of it Sinduja Potheri Krishnakumar In the warm  breeze, the  aroma of  the Totapuri  mangoes,  turning a  shade  darker by  the day,  would †ll  my vision  and heart Cynics say that early to bed and early to rise makes a pension er a nuisance around the house. So a recently retired man de cided to switch seamlessly from a 30year nineto†ve o’ce routine to alife of quality time, and not be a nuisance while he is at it. In pursuance of a morningwalk regime, he sets the alarm for 6 a.m., but his bladder wakes him up at 5.30 a.m. The rest of his household is in deep slumber. In his recently adopted selfsu’cient mode, he goes to the kitchen to make himself acup of tea. His main aim is to con duct a noiseless kitchen operation, and not to awaken the entire house hold at that ungodly hour, earning everyone else™s ire. He switches on the light and †nds it too bright, ap pearing to light up the whole house. It may invite censure from his sleep disturbed family. So he switches it o“ and settles for work in semidark ness, martyr that he is. He tiptoes around the kitchen for 10 minutes, hoping to locate the elu sive kettle which he suspects that his wife has deliberately kept hidden, just to send him on a meaningless treasurehunt, and also to show him who owns the kitchen. He †nally spots the kettle, partially visible un der a pyramid of washed vessels.  Hoping for a noiseless ma noeuvre, he gingerly pulls it out inch by inch. The malign pyramid waits till the kettle is 99% eased out and then crashes down spectacular ly, causing him to experience a mi nor cardiac episode. He holds his breath for the next †ve minutes waiting for a furious complaint from the startled household. F anned out This is where science comes to his rescue, in the form of noisecancel lation. In all the rooms of his house, the fans are whirring, slashing air fe rociously at the maximum regulator setting (which is the only setting his family knows), and the crash of the vessels in the kitchen does not pene trate through this sound barrier of air being massacred. So far, so good. It is a weekday evening, and the family is settled in front of the TV. He is the last in the queue to watch his favourite channel. So he retires to his room, sur†ng YouTube on his laptop. It is a weekday morning. The rest of the family has gone out for work. The household is at peace again, with just he and his wife there. He is trying to read a book . From the kitchen, his wife is advising that  he should be more involved and proac tive about this and that.  She stops midsentence and lets out a horrormovie screech, rushing out and breathlessly announcing the appearance of a monstrous winged insect .He goes in, swats the tiny beetle and has a Eureka moment of realisa tion. If he is to retain his  relevance in the household, especially in the eyes of his old lady, he needs to keep astock of spiders and tiny beetles in ajar and release them in the kitchen periodically whenever she begins her lecture. ........................................................................s agitex@gmail.com Pensioners™ predicament How to be useful and not be a ‚nuisance™ T homas Paul Cover story The lack of judicial aid has created a visible abyss for registered sex workers in India.

FEEDBACK Letters to the Magazinecan be emailed separately tomag.letters@thehindu.co.inIt is a great leveller. It has the power to make every vehicle Š no matter its size, the VIP quotient of its occupant or the nuisance value of its horn Š painfully wait at its behest.  In Indian cities, railway level crossings at most places are a sore reminder of the deeprooted inertia and lack of foresight of our city planners in implementing alternatives such as overbridges or underpasses.  Level crossings are a relic of an era when tra’c volumes were onetenth of what they are now. That was a time when every middleclass family™s ambition was ﬁHamara Bajajﬂ and very few actually got to ride one, as a waiting period of four or †ve years for the scooter was quite common and things like EMI were not even heard of. The scene near level crossings is of utter chaos driven by the hurry of motorists, though a little patience and respect for order (something very foreign to our nature) will go a long way in making matters easier. As the gates tilt down to a close to the accompaniment of a buzzing sound, some bikers race to sneak through with the adeptness of movie stuntmen.  Once the gates are down, the dreary wait for the train to pass begins, and so does the crafty jugaad mentality of motorists. Like rats and cockroaches, those on twowheelers manage to sneak past the waiting tra’c, to be close to the gate so that they can scoot o“ the moment it opens. By the time the train arrives, the tra’c buildup on both sides resembles rival armies arrayed in a battle formation, eagerly waiting for the war bugle to go o“.  Once the gates are opened, all driving etiquette takes a back seat and Darwinian instincts take over. The size of the vehicle and number of wheels become crucial. Those steering burly sixwheeler trucks try to bully those behind the wheels of small cars. Luggage autorickshaws laden with steel rods intimidate twowheeler riders by subjecting them to close shaves.  For all motorists in general, it™s a nerveracking oneinchatatime rite of passage as they have to maintain their cool amid highdecibel horns, heated exchanges and brinkmanship by fellow motorists. By the time the chaos gets over, it™s time to down the gates for the next train.  ....................................................................................................s hajilkumark@gmail.com The melee at  level crossings Once the gates are opened, all driving etiquette takes a back seat and it™s a free for all K.

CMYKNDX THE HINDU MagazineDELHISunday,July11,2021 03COVER STORY As you approach Pokhran, the sky line is taken over by  giants.  They are wind turbines and lofty steel towers that standtall against the yellow sand dunes, making the landscape look like a dystopian Lego town. The  tops of the towers are painted a menacing red; they stand tall as if holding hands  with the power lines. Close to Pokhran, where India once †exed its nuclear muscle, a new  power struggle is emerging in the sand dunes of Rajasthan. This one is between the people who live there and the power companies that promise clean and green energy to the nation. Caught in this cross“re is a critically endangered bird that has been on a collision course with the power companies™ high tension wires . The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimates that about 15% of  the great Indian bustard (GIB) popula tion dies each year due to collision with pow er lines, making this  the most signi“cant threat to the majestic bird today. The  bustard has had a chequered  history; its unusual name stopped it from being de clared the ‚national bird™ of India. Once found in large numbers across the country,  Rajas than  is now home  to the single largest viable population of the species. But the State has other plans for the bustard™s habitat Š an ar ray of solar and wind energy projects.  A WII report from 2020 minced no words: ‚unless power line mortality is mitigated urgently, ex tinction of GIBs is certain™, it said. And that led to  a Supreme Court  order in April 2021 man dating that all power lines in both the ‚poten tial™ and the ‚priority™ habitats of the  bird  be laid underground. This was a pathbreaking order, as it  included not just the small area of the Desert National Park in Jaisalmer, but also encompassed a much larger tract of the last remaining suitable habitat, as this would en sure the longterm conservation of the species and the successful reintroduction of captive bred birds in the  future. Near Pokhran, I meet Sumer Singh Bhati, who owns more than 300 camels. With his straw hat and camera strapped around his neck, he could pass of as an enthusiastic tour guide. What he is  enthusiastic about is birds. These days, however, his phone card is full of images of dead birds that have crashed against the power lines.  Bhati says he has be come a champion for the GIB in the last “ve years; the plight of the dead birds moved him. He™s also upset that the  Degray Oran or the sacred grove Š said to be over 600 years old Š used by his community for grazing their lives tock  is now being used by the power compa nies to install power lines. What angered the people of his village most was  the destruction of the trees they had preserved for genera tions. The National Green Tribunal  prohibited the laying of power lines in the  sacred grove ,but this did not stop the violations .C olossal towers We are standing in the blazing heat with the colossal towers above our heads, in the heart of the  Oran , when a car pulls up from one of the power companies.  The men want to know why we are here. Since the order from the Supreme Court, eve ryone is nervous. They as sess us from a distance, make enquiries from our driver, and leave. We walk  further, and I am curious  about the co lourful discs,  or ‚bird di verters™,  which give a rather aesthetic look to the deathly wires. Diverters are essentially bright plastic discs that appear like  Christmas lights and are meant to alert birds in †ight from a distance to avoid collision. But there is  de bate in the scienti“c communi ty about their e‘cacy for bustards. The sun is now so bright it is impossible to look ahead with the naked eye. We continue walking; up ahead, a group of four men are hard at work; they say they are migrants from Bi har employed as daily wage workers by the  re newable power companies. They have been hired to install diverters every six feet. Like cowboys, they suspend themselves from the hanging wires, pull themselves up 2030 feet above the ground to tie the diverters; there is no umbrella, no shade, no tree to protect them from the blistering heat. Not even a safe ty net in case they fall. The work continues at afrenetic pace, perhaps since the Supreme Court has directed that till the lines are taken underground, these diverters must be in stalled. The workers have a long day ahead. C on†icting reports Ashort breeze makes the de†ectors sway like wind chimes, but Bhati says the birds are still colliding with the wires. His observation is backed by scientists. Devesh Gadhvi, an ecol ogist, conservationist, and member of the Su preme Courtappointed committee that will decide the feasibility of transmission lines to be taken underground, says: ﬁMeta analysis shows diverters reduce mortality by 50% for birds in general, but the reduction is lower for bustards, according to recent evidence.ﬂ  Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, CEO of the Na tional Solar Energy Federation of India, dis agrees. He wants to present research to the Supreme Court committee that diverters will work. ﬁWe have reviewed  experiences from some 40 countries, and in some of these ,birds from the bustard family were a’ected too,  for instance in Spain, Namibia and Hun gary. These countries have installed bird di verters, line markers, and UV paint on the transmission lines to mitigate collision, and the results were very promising.  In some cases, there was a  re duction in the mortality rate by as much as 95%,ﬂ he says.  Sumit Dookia, an ecologist, who has been working in the desert State, believes the local people are central to conserv ing the species. Doo kia recalls his “rst sight ing of the GIB with  Asad Rahmani, one of the most vo cal advocates for saving this precious bird. ﬁIn 2002, I got an opportunity to join Dr. Rahmani and I saw my  “rst GIB , a pair, in Bikaner dis trict.ﬂ For Dookia, that mo ment was lifechanging, and he started mobilising people to support  GIB conservation. His e’orts paid o’ Š  there are now many GIB mascots in Rajasthan who  have come forward to help or report violations of the court or ders. But violations continue, and the poten tial GIB habitat is huge, so monitoring and compliance with various court orders has be come a catandmouse game between the vil lagers and the companies. Tracing accountability As we walk around, we notice  an earthmover that has been deployed to dig up the ground for new power lines. When we  ask the men at work, they say they are daily wage workers but con“rm they are digging the land for new power lines. Since no one is a fulltime em ployee, tracing back accountability to any company is challenging.  By late afternoon, we make our way to wards a grassland patch where we are told there may be some chance of catching a glimpse of the GIB. Our tired eyes get  some vi sual relief  from the hundreds of spinytailed li zards that pop up from the ground for a few seconds or scurry across the grass .Just as the last of the sun™s rays hit the grassland, we get lucky. Up ahead in the dis tance is a male bird. It™s only when you see the bustard in the wild  that you realise what the fuss is all about. There is something royal about the bird as it surveys its territory with its head held high. If this was a Disney musi cal, I can imagine the bird bursting into song, holding its white breeches . To be in the pre sence of this grand old bird of the agropasto ral landscape makes you deeply conscious of its value, not just as a mascot of the grasslands but as a crucial piece in the ecojigsaw.  Our role is to ensure it is not wiped o’ the face of the planet. Perhaps the GIB needs a smart marketing strategy, something that endears it to tourists, like the tiger™s. E cological footprint Meanwhile, emboldened by the State govern ment, the power companies are working on ways to avoid implementing the court order .Pulipaka admits there are problems. ﬁCost is just one of the factors. It is a globally esta blished fact that undergrounding is signi“ cantly expensive,  especially for high voltage lines.ﬂ The threat in this habitat is not the only such green energy vs. wildlife con†ict in the country.  Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary in Maha rashtra, for instance, has one of the largest wind farms, which has impacted biodiversity, speci“cally the behavioural activities of the fanthroated lizard. Wind farms in the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat threaten to impact ma rine biodiversity. Andhra Lake Wind Farm, close to Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra,  has led to the felling of trees and diversion of forest land. This, in turn, has de prived local people of access to common  re sources.  Thus far, it™s fossil fuel companies that have had the worst environmental records Š not just in terms of pollution but also land grabs and violation of human rights . Renewa ble energy companies have promoted them selves as the ‚noble™ alternative, providing clean  energy, free from carbon emissions. As India turns to such projects on a large scale, one must remember that while they may be clean, they still have an ecological footprint. And if they want to retain their ‚clean™ image, they have to  control their environmental im pact.  The predicament  of the bustard  gives them a chance to rise to the occasion. Let them take their transmission lines under ground so that the  great bird soars safely again............................................................................................The writer is an awardwinning journalist and a uthor of  Rewilding in India .  WILDLIFE CONFLICT ower Transmission lines are the greatest threat to the endangered great Indian bustard. In April, the Supreme Court asked wind and solar companies to take their lines underground.

eration, not only because all the sta tions on the northern section of the line had been bombed out, but also because every inch of track and ev ery nut and bolt had been stripped away by the Tigers, who™d made use of the iron for weapons, bunkers, and anything else they required in their typically meticulous way. It had taken several years for the govern ment to relay the track, and when the line was o†cially reopened the previous year it had been celebrated with great fanfare, the government using the occasion to symbolize how the entire island was now back un der its control, a marker of their achievement as liberators of the country. That had been in 2014, to This brooding novel begins with a telephone call out of the blue informing Krishan that his grand mother™s caretaker, Rani, has been found dead at the bottom of a well in her village in the north of Sri Lanka. Suddenly, the world Krishnan has left behind seems to be calling, stirring memories and desires.  Krishan makes the long journey by train from Colombo into the wartorn Northern Province for Rani™s funeral, revisiting a land scarred by the 30year  civil war. It™s a personal journey as well as the journey of a nation trying to †nd its identity while negotiating the chasm between ex pectation and reality. In this excerpt from Chap ter 7, Krishnan is on the train to Kilinochchi, watching the halfforgotten landscape unfold be fore his eyes, pondering the distance Sri Lanka has travelled in the long years since he left the North behind. It always made Krishan a little uncomfortable that he™d cho sen to return while so many Ta mils were willing to risk eve rything to leave, a choice that had only been possible, he knew, be cause of the fortune and privilege of his circumstances, the safe distance of his own life from the violence and poverty of the northeast. It was true that his father had been a casualty of one of the Tiger bombings in Colom bo, that he had in this sense been deeply a“ected by the war, but the fact was that he™d grown up in com fort, in a house of his own far away from the actual ‘ghting, that he™d never had to experience violence di rectly, neither gunshots, shelling, nor displacement, nothing more than casual racism here and there, threatening interrogations by police and soldiers on the street. The idea of doing social work in the northeast would have never even occurred to him, probably, had he not been so insulated from the traumas of the war, and in a way his departure after two years had only underscored how di“erent his life was from those who™d spent their lives in the north east, those for whom coming and go ing wasn™t simply a matter of choice. Krishan looked at the scenes passing outside as they left the town, the out lines of the trees in the distance dis torted by the intensity of the heat, and feeling a little restless he took out his phone and looked at the time.  They were less than an hour from Kilinochchi and he wasn™t sure what to do with himself, whether to try reading or listening to music, neither of which he felt like doing. He didn™t want to remain seated, had been sit ting for several hours and felt an urge to stand up, then realized that he hadn™t yet smoked that day, that it would be nice to leave the carriage and have a cigarette now that he was ‘nally in the north. He reached down and took out his lighter and pack from his bag, glanced around quickly to make sure no one hap pened to be walking through the car riage, then stood up and began mak ing his way along the aisle, holding the seat backs for support till he passed out into the small corridor between the carriages. He waited a few seconds to make sure he was alone, then lighting a cigarette dis creetly against the wall he pulled open the train door, latched it to the wall, and leaned outside, his face im mediately assailed by a blast of hot, dry wind, his eyes by the penetrat ing, preternatural brightness of the day. Just a stone™s throw from the train he could see the A9 running in paral lel with the tracks, veering some times closer and sometimes farther away, the air above its smooth black surface trembling from the heat of the tarmac. The highway was hardly ahighway, consisting of only a single lane for each direction of tra†c, but because it was the main road linking north and south it had assumed a kind of epic proportion in the minds of everyone who™d lived through the war. The southern section had been controlled by the government for most of the ‘ghting, the northern section by the Tigers, each side man ning their portion of the border with heavy forti‘cations and multiple checkpoints, so that for the better part of twenty‘ve years it had, like the train line, been completely inop erative. It had been reopened ‘nally in 2009, just a few months after the defeat of the Tigers, the military quickly ‘lling up the craters, demin ing the adjacent land, and repaving the road so it was ready for civilian use, though for a long time soldiers continued checking every single vehicle that crossed the border, go ing methodically through every sin gle compartment and every single piece of luggage if the passengers were Tamil. The train line had taken much longer to be put back into op ward the end of his time in the northeast, when he™d become so used to traveling by bus that he didn™t even think to use the train, and looking at the highway from his slightly di“erent vantage point now, Krishan found himself thinking of all the journeys he™d made between Co lombo and Ja“na since returning to the island, the intense longing he™d felt, during those ‘rst months espe cially, as he gazed out from his bus window at these same unending landscapes of brush and palmyra, landscapes so ’at and dry and unfor giveable that it seemed sometimes almost miraculous that so many gen erations had worked life and suste nance out of the earth. It was hard to say what it was about the northeast that had drawn him there after so many years abroad, what it was that had taken root so deeply inside him that he abandoned the life he™d built for himself in Delhi in search of another one here. It was true that guilt had played some part, guilt for the rela tive ease of his life growing up, guilt for the fact that he™d spent so much of his twenties lost in academic texts, but there was also something in the sparse, desolate beauty of the region that had brought him here, he thought as he gazed out of the train, something much stronger and more substantial than guilt. He™d spent so many hours looking at im ages of the northeastern countryside during his time in Delhi, not during his initial obsession with the war™s ‘ nal massacres but afterward, sens ing in those images of sprawling ‘elds and thick jungle something an cient and almost mythical, someth ing that made him dream of a possi ble ful‘llment without knowing how or from what source. Compelled by some need to dwell more on the ori gins of the war, to understand the nature of the longings that had led to such a devastating conclusion, he™d begun reading about the earlier, more idealistic days of the separatist movement, and it was the story of Kuttimani more than anything else, he remembered now, that had cap tivated him at the time, that had crystallized the longing to live in the northeast that was just beginning to take hold of him.  ........................................................................Extracted from  A Passage North by Anuk Arudpragasam, published by Penguin Hamish Hamilton  t his month.

CMYKNDX THE HINDU MagazineDELHISunday,July11,2021 05Literary Review Ayear after the Pe ople™s Liberation Army began to amass troops at the Line of Ac tual Control, an act which led to blood being spilt for the †rst time in 45 years on the IndiaChina boundary at Galwan, a slew of books has put the spot light on the bilateral rela tionship. Most of all, there is renewed curiosity about why China does what it does, especially when it concerns India, which, at least in India™s own percep tion, has not provoked Chi nese aggressions. On the downslide  Kanti Bajpai™s book  India Versus Chi na: Why They Are Not Friends at tempts to answer the question, with the help of four Ps: Perceptions, Pe rimeters, other Partnerships and Power asymmetry. The book, the se cond in a series from Juggernaut pu blishers after diplomat and scholar Husain Haqqani™s  India Vs Pakistan: Why Can't We Just be Friends? , con tains a concise version of the history of IndiaChina ties, tracing a trajec tory on the downslide. Bajpai says while both countries may have held each other in high esteem in ancient times, they now look at each other with disdain which ranges from the casual racism of the Chinese and In dians towards each other (epithets like ﬁAsanﬂ and ﬁChinkyﬂ respec tively) to complete mistrust of each other™s designs on their territories. Much of the Chinese impression of India has been shaped by Indian pol icemen who were posted to China by the British during the Opium wars, argues Baj pai (the term Asan or Ah san refers to Indians pejora tively as ﬁUncle Tomsﬂ in the West).  Meanwhile, the ﬁperim eterﬂ or boundary dispute has hit an impasse, which the author ascribes to the power gap between the two countries. ﬁFrom a position of strength, China does not see the need to accommo date, while from a position of weakness, India feels it cannot a“ord to do so and risk further loss of standing and stra tegic autonomy,ﬂ writes Bajpai.  R ealistic picture  The author provides a fairly realistic picture of China™s growing arrogance and unilateral aggressions, especial ly in the past decade, but concludes that the two con‘agrations between India and China in 1962 and 2020 are more likely to have been caused by Chinese misperceptions and over reactions to India™s actions. On the 1962 war, for example, Bajpai holds on to John Garver™s view ( Protracted Contest: SinoIndian Rivalry in the Twentieth Century ) that the  casus bel liwere Tibet and India™s shelter to the Dalai Lama, which China read as New Delhi fomenting its overthrow in Tibet. In 2020, he surmises that China took a suspicious view of In dian infrastructure development near the Karakoram highway as in tended to constrain Chinese pro gress on the Belt and Road Initiative, further aggravated by Home Minis ter Amit Shah™s intemperate lan guage in Parliament while discussing Aksai Chin after the government™s reorganisation of Jammu and Kash mir and amendment in Article 370. There is then the question of India™s other strategic partnerships, most notably with the United States, which in 2020, like 1962, is being read in Beijing as a plan to contain China with India playing a ﬁjuniorﬂ partner to the U.S.  Finally, Bajpai makes the point that the power gap between the two is growing, making it more di’cult for the two countries to forge better ties for the foreseeable future, ad ding that their best relationship was in the 1940s and 1950s when they were more equal. The book points out that on absolute and relative terms, China is far ahead of India, and given current growth rates, the present GDP gap of $11.5 trillion bet ween them will only increase in the next few decades. In addition, it says that China far outstrips India on hu man development indicators and soft power.  B leak prognosis  Where the book possibly errs is in of fering the least optimistic construct on all issues between the two coun tries. While other scholars have held, for example, that India and China have had a connection for 5,000 years without a war until 1962, Bajpai describes a relationship that with a few exceptional periods has never been friendly. The book describes Hu Shih™s famous 1937 paper for Harvard University ﬁThe Indianisation of China: A Case Study of Cultural Borrowingﬂ, as a castiga tion of Indian Buddhism™s enfee bling impact on China, when in fact the paper also describes China™s ﬁgratefulﬂ receipt of the ﬁgift of Buddhismﬂ. ﬁNever before had Chi na seen a religion so rich in imagery, so beautiful and captivating in ritual ism and so bold in cosmological and metaphysical speculations. Like a poor beggar suddenly halting before amagni†cent storehouse of precious stones of dazzling brilliancy and splendour, China was overwhelmed, bašed and overjoyed,ﬂ Hu de scribed in the paper. The prognosis from Bajpai™s book, as a result, is bleak, and as suggested by its title, would mean that India and China are not, and cannot be friends. This conclusion is possibly a cleareyed view of the present, but not necessa rily of the future of two countries which share a 3,500 km boundary and bilateral trade, even postCO VID, postGalwan, that exceeds all others (for India). While the modus vivendi, former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon has said, is no doubt broken,  a working relationship is by no means redun dant or unnecessary.

With the COVID19 toll crossing unimagin able numbers worldwide, there is a sense of dread about the uncertain future. The last breath and the resultant fullstop have evoked considerable literature. In recent times we have had Arun Shourie™s  Preparing for Death and Siddharth Dhanvant Shanghvi™s  Loss . Rabindranath Ta gore, of course, wrote some of his most wellknown songs after perso nal tragedy. In 1903, a year after his wife Mrinalini Debi passed away, Ta gore penned these lines, ﬁthere is sorrow ( dukkho ), there is death ( mrityu ), yet there is peace ( shanti ), there is joy ( ananda)...ﬂ Contemplat ing on the fear prevailing over the coronavirus, Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa says people †nd it di’ cult to accept that all of life™s beauty ultimately belongs to death, ﬁand that at any moment it may come to an end.ﬂ  ‚ Permanent scattering™  June 10, 2020 was the worst day of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie™s life. She lost her father, James Nyowe Ad ichie, at a time the world was in lock down due to COVID19 Š he was in Nigeria, the writer far away in Amer ica. He had a kidney ailment not thought to be serious, and speaking for the millions aggrieved by the vi rus, she wondered: ﬁHow is it that the world keeps going, breathing in and out unchanged, while in my soul there is a permanent scattering?ﬂ  In  Notes on Grief , a moving inti mation of loss and mortality, she writes that grief is a cruel kind of education. ﬁYou learn how ungentle mourning can be, how full of anger. You learn how glib condolences can feel. You learn how much grief is about language, the failure of lan guage and the grasping for lan guage.ﬂ Adichie †nds it impossible to think of her father in the past tense Š he  was not; he  is . She backs away from condolences, is deeply riled by mentions of age because that is irre levant in grief, detests the word ‚de mise™, and doesn™t feel comforted by ‚presumptuous™ words of comfort like ‚he is in a better place™ or ‚he is resting™.  Help from a biography  Is there value in the Igbo, African way of grieving, Adichie wonders, ﬁwhere you take every call and tell and retell the story of what hap pened, where isolation is anathema and ‚stop crying™ a refrain.ﬂ As she grapples with her grief, she rereads a biography of her father, ‚the fore most professor of Statistics™, and re calls his ﬁcertain kind of colonial African education, prudent and proper, Latinloving and rulefollow ing.ﬂ There is no easy way to over come her sorrow but slowly, Adichie looks at old photographs, his Sudo ku books, videos and papers. She re members hailing him as ‚OdeluOra Abba (one who writes for our com munity)™ and her father calling her ‚Nwoke Neli (roughly, the equivalent of many men)™ among other names. She is reminded of her father™s sense of humour, already dry, which ﬁcrisped deliciously as he agedﬂ; his sense of duty, a ﬁgentle man and a gentleman.ﬂ An ode to her father al so becomes a history lesson on Nige ria and its mutinies over land, oil, people. A friend sends Adichie a line from her own novel  Half of a Yellow Sun : ﬁGrief was the celebration of love, those who could feel real grief were lucky to have loved.ﬂ  The layers of loss make life feel papery thin, writes Adichie, whose mother passed away on March 1 this year. ﬁHow Does a Heart Break Twice? How can my mother be gone forever, and so soon after my father,ﬂ she asked in a tearful tribute to Grace Ifeoma Adichie. Even meta physical poet John Donne™s words, ﬁDeath, thou shalt dieﬂ, can be of lit tle comfort in the time of grief.

Yet, as a  species, humans have lost the ability to  breathe correctly. A journalist travels  the world to discover the science  behind ancient breathing practices to  †gure out what went wrong and how  to †x it. Reading Rasheed Kidwai™s  House of Scindias: A Sa ga of Power, Politics and Intrigue during a time when second, third and in some cases even fourth generation inheritors are grappling with political legacy and the manner of its transfer, is an interesting experience. As I read it, I was also reporting on the fullscale revolt within the Paswan family, and  of course the unending tussle within the Congress party to settle the question of leadership. S tamp of authority  The proli†c number of political leaders that the Scindia fa mily has spawned deserves to be recorded but the manner in which sociologist Max Weber™s seminal work on pow er and authority has worked its way through the story of one family is even more fascinating. Weber distinguished  bet ween three kinds of authority Š tradi tional, rational and charismatic. Tradi tional authority accrues from respect in society based on old established cul tural patterns, the rational from legal frameworks and bureaucratic struc tures like governments and charismatic authority is derived from an indivi dual™s personal charisma and magne tism.  In the Scindias, one can see the in tertwining of all three types of authori ty over generations, its scope and limita tions as well. And while some members of the clan traversed opposing ideologi cal planes Š Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia started o“ as a Congress MP and later helped found the Bharatiya Janata Party, her son  Madhavrao Scindia was in the Jan Sangh (precursor to BJP) and moved to the Congress, and his son, Jyotiraditya, did the opposite, being in the Congress †rst and then moving to the BJP Š the book is more about their successful negotiation in being in power.  The book covers a swathe of history, from the origin al founder of the Scindia clan, Ranoji Rao Scindia, to the cur rent generation. It delves into the Scindias™ relationship with the Peshwas of Pune, the Mughals in Delhi, their role in the First War of Independence of 1857 right up to postin dependent India. What is interesting is that at cruc ial mo ments in India™s history, the clan managed to prevail Š par ticularly telling is the fact that the late Jiwajirao Scindia, Maharaja of Gwalior at the time of independence, was one of the †rst princely states to accede to India even when oth ers protested and provided a role model for many to follow.  M ystery fortune  The book presents a chapter on each of the Scindias  who made it into public life, and Kidwai peppers the nar rative with interesting anecdotes including the missing ﬁbe ejakﬂ or map key for a fortune which legend has it that it is lodged in underground vaults in Scindiaowned palaces and forts. My personal favourite is the appeal made during elections by family members when on opposite sides of the political spectrum Š folklore has it that whenever a Scindia was asked to campaign against another, they would simply tell the crowd  meri izzat rakh lena (protect my dignity), leaving the crowd confused as to what was expected of them.  Kidwai re‘ects on the nature of dynasty and the endu rance and dexterity required for staying on in power, whether as a crowned ruler, or a democratically elected ﬁpublic servantﬂ. It also shows that the ability to stay at the helm of public a“airs and the transfer of political  legacies seldom make for comfortable dinner conversations in fami lies, something newer political dynasties may want t o pay heed to.

Over the last couple of weeks, streaming plat forms in India and America have issued some curious ‚instruc tions™ alongside preview screeners routinely sent to entertainment jour nalists and critics. Writing for the website Gizmodo, Charles Pullam Moore revealed that Net†ix had asked reviewers of their new animat ed miniseries  Resident Evil: In†nite Darkness (adapted from the  Resident Evil series of video games) to not ref er to realworld politics or events. This zombie apocalypse story in volves global health crises, refugees and their relationship with global hu manitarian organisations. And yet, a Net†ix executive somewhere thought ablanket ban on realworld referenc es is a fair ask. Over in India, Disney Hotstar pulled o“ a similar gambit with  Gra han , their new miniseries, which is based on a Hindi novel by Satya Vyas called  Chaurasi (‚84™ in Hindi). As the name suggests, the story is set against the backdrop of the 1984 antiSikh pogrom. And yet, Hotstar, in the leng thy embargo letter that accompanied its preview screeners for  Grahan ,wrote inexplicable stu“  like this :ﬁGrahan is a work of ‘ction and is in spired by Satya Vyas™s novel  Chaura si; please do not compare any scenes, plots or characters to any realworld events.ﬂ Another bulletpoint instruc tion screeched, with capital letters and bureaucratic word salad: ﬁKindly do NOT connect the show to any cur rent or past situations/ activities around the political happenings.ﬂ To issue ﬁreview guidelinesﬂ along side a copy of your new movie re quires a special kind of contempt for journalists. But let™s ignore that for now and focus on what these two in cidents are really about: controlling the narrative. In India, the increasing ly draconian regulations for stream ing platforms have meant that their executives are paranoid. They™re pe rennially scared of shows being banned, FIRs being ‘led, e’gies be ing burned and so on. No streaming platform wants another  Tandav on its hands, basically. One can discuss the intersection of art and politics till kingdom come, but meanwhile let™s not forget that Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub was dragged to court for so mething his character said in the mid dle of a scene. B ig bullies The fear, then, is understandable to an extent, but the answer is surely not these laughable ﬁinstructionsﬂ and ﬁguidelinesﬂ being sent to critics and entertainment journalists.  It means that the likes of Net†ix and Disney Hotstar are also behaving like bullies here. Older and more esta blished critics may laugh these emails o“ and perhaps skip writing about these shows and ‘lms altogether (as many chose to do with  Grahan , in cluding myself), but to early career journalists, these emails might come across as intimidation; the power im balance between billiondollar cor porations and perennially broke 20 something journalists needs no elab oration. Whatever the intention behind these ﬁreview guidelinesﬂ might be, Net†ix and Disney Hotstar should at the very least have realised this. But then again, it has proven to be open season on ‘lm critics lately. In her review of Net†ix India™s new ‘lm Haseen  Dillruba , critic Shubhra Gup ta wrote that she felt Taapsee Pannu™s acting was becoming repetitive. Whether or not one agrees with this assessment, it is undeniably a com ment on Pannu™s work, and does not say anything about her character or personality in real life. Pannu, ho wever, who has 4.5 million followers on Twitter, called Gupta a ﬁtroll crit icﬂ, complaining that the review amounted to a ﬁpersonal digﬂ (which it isn™t, not even close). RIP Gupta™s mentions, as they say on Twitter. Good faith criticism In this age of misinformation and cle verly crafted halftruths, it™s not sur prising that there is widespread deri sion of Š and confusion around Š the role of the professional critic. Millio naire actors and billiondollar corpo rations are  united in their contempt for good faith criticism. Their appe tites will not be met by anything short of universal adoration it seems. Critics are not publicity drones that can be cranked up on command and voiceprogrammed to steer clear of lampposts marked ‚politics™. Crit ics are similarly disinterested in tak ing ﬁpersonal digsﬂ at actors or direc tors. Not because we can™t or won™t ,but mostly because these ‚personal lives™ tend to be deathly boring (with afew notable exceptions). We gener ally have much more interesting things to write about. We would, however, appreciate a modicum of common sense every now and then, especially from the leaders of the very industries (the problems around criticism  are hardly limited to the ‘lm world) we™re writ ing about. BINGE WATCH Critics are not publicity drones In this age of misinformation and cleverly crafted halftruths, the widespread misunderstanding of the role of the critic is not surprising GETTY IMAGES/ ISTOCK Aditya Mani Jha,writer and journalist, is working on his †rst book of non†ction.CMYKNDX DELHITHE HINDU MagazineSunday,July11,2021 06WIDE ANGLE GREEN HUMOUR  BY ROHAN CHAKRAVARTY Deep inside an Arctic mountain, on an archi pelago in Norway, lies guarded the digitally restored image of one of the earliestsurviving Indian paint ings from the 6th century Badami caves in Karnataka. This image  joinsanother painting from the Ajanta caves, also  now preserved for pos terity at the Arctic World Archive (AWA). In the world of Indian  herit age, this is a  milestone because not only do these images rescue  original masterpieces from getting lost in time, they are also made accessible to a global audience.  And soon, AI will become a part of the restoration work. Renowned art historian and pho tographer Benoy K. Behl, who  res tored these  images using his own technique over years, says the signif icance of these pictures is that they establish ﬁIndia™s continuous tradi tion of ancient painting.ﬂ Says Behl: ﬁIndia has one of the ‘nest tradi tions of painting and yet they are not known well because most  are hid den in the dark recesses of temples and caves.ﬂ The Ajanta paintings of the 5th century are, of course, well known, but Behl points out  this is not quite the case with ones  from earlier periods or later, for about 700 years. ﬁThe Ajanta paintings  are thus considered a †ash in the pan.ﬂ  The quality of art in these ancient Indian paintings were seen in the West much later, with the Impres sionists, says Behl. The digitally restored images are based on Behl™s own photographs, taken years ago .  ﬁLight was not al lowed  in the caves and so the paint ings were not seen clearly. So when I used my technique of photograph ing in extremely low light, akin to darkness, art critics and others said we had conquered darkness.ﬂ There on, he photographed many other ancient paintings.  In 2001, Behl reached the Badami caves. Much of the paintingswere already lost by then and by 2008, when a  National Geographic team visited the site to document his work, ﬁthey could hardly even see the paintings.ﬂ While art critics around the world marvelled at Behl™s work,  most peo ple may not appreciate its signi‘ cance. And so began his work of dig itally restoring the images. It took Behl 19 years to complete the digital restoration of the Ajanta cave paint ing; he ‘nished in 2019, just in time to celebrate 200 years of  the discov ery of the caves, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  In 2020, Sapio Analytics, a Mum baibased company, which focuses on creating highend databased al gorithms powered by AI, ap proached Behl to join hands with them to restore and preserve  images in the  AWA along with other digital artefacts from around the world. The  archives also has  manuscripts from the Vatican library, political histories, masterpieces from di“e rent eras and parts of the world, and samples of scienti‘c breakthroughs.  It is here that ancient Indian paintings that are at risk of being lost to time can ‘nd a home,  reminders of India™s rich art history.  The res tored image of Bodhisattva King Ma hajanaka, the Ajanta cave painting, was sent to AWA in 2020, and this May, the image of the Queen and At tendants, from the Badami cave paintings, was virtually unveiled  before the world. These paintings, says Behl, embodysome of the hallmarks of Indian art with their  sublime, in wardlooking expressions and a compassion that transcends  physi cal boundaries .Looking into the future, Hardik Somani of Sapio Analytics  says they are now in the process of developing AI to help in  restoration . ﬁA dataset of reference work is being used to develop  AI that will use deep learn ing techniques to restore  damaged murals,ﬂ he says. A damaged area of amural, for instance, will be res tored by altering the  pixels of the damaged elements through mathe matical inference of the neighbour ing, undamaged part. Highend scanning of photographs of the origi nal artwork taken by Behl will aid in the process.  In the pipeline  is similar restora tion work of paintings of the 3rd cen tury Pitalkhora Buddhist caves in Maharashtra. Sapio Analytics is  now in talks with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations  to showcase Behl™s original photographs,  after they  are digitally restored, in exhibi tions around the world planned for 2022. Behl however cautions that it is better not to attempt restoration of an art piece  if it is going to be res tored  wrongly. ﬁThere is a tendency to ‚overrestore™, make things too co lourful.  The purpose of restoration should be what art is meant to be :the hope to in†uence another hu man being.ﬂ ........................................................................The writer is a Jodhpurbased f reelance journalist.

1On July 11 1893, Japanese entrepre neur Mikimoto Kokichi, after ma ny failures and near bankruptcy, was able to farm and create the very †rst arti†cial version of a valuable gemstone. This was a huge revolu tion in jewellery and once, on meet ing Mikimoto, Thomas Edison said he had achieved what was ﬁsup posed to be biologically impossibleﬂ. What had Mikimoto created that nat urally occurs whensome dirt irri tates a mollusc ?2Helenite is a green obsidianlike gemstone that was created acci dentally after a certain natural phe nomenon occurred in 1980. Local timber workers were using acety lene torches to free salvage equip ment when they noticed that the heat was transforming the ash and rock into a beautiful green colour. It has since been recreated away from the source, but it gets its name from ageographical entity in Washington whose activity in 1980 caused devas tation. From what entity do we get helenite? 3In 2014, scientists at Bayerisches Geoinstitut in Germany success fully created diamond gemstones us ing much higher pressure than found in the earth™s core, where dia monds are usually formed. The starting material was something you would see on your breakfast table. The process is messier and slower, but proves that carbon in any form can be converted. What did the scientists turn into diamond that you usually have either crunchy or smooth and on toast? 4Chrysoberyl is a gemstone that  is an aluminate of beryllium. Nor mally yellowishgreen in colour, there is a variety known as alexan drite that  has the unique characte ristic of pleochroism, which is an op tical phenomenon that depends on how you view the gemstone. What di“erence would you notice in  alex andrite depending on whether you viewed it under natural sunlight or arti†cial incandescent light? 5This  gemstone is a form of lignite. It is derived from wood that has changed under extreme pressure. Its English name comes from the French word  jaiet . It gets its charac teristic dark colour thanks to high carbon concentration, which led to its name being used as an adjective to mean ‚as dark a black as possible™. What is the name of this gemstone? 6Painite is a very rare borate min eral, with only two specimens ever having been cut into gem stones. Discovered by a gem dealer after whom it was named, the miner al is extremely rare as it contains both zirconium and boron, two ele ments that rarely interact naturally. Painite is found only in the Mogok area, where rubies were once mined . Which country, whose capi tal was Rangoon till 2006 and is Nay pyidaw now, is this region in? 7Biogenic gemstones are those that are formed from an organic source created through natural bio logical processes rather than geolog ical processes. The most common one is pearl. Certain ammonites are fossilis ed in such a way that they be come a type of gemstone called am molite. A rare biogenic gemstone is fossilis ed tree resin, which has been valued since Neolithic times and written about since the fourth centu ryBCE. It is the softest gemstone. What is this gemstone that was the starting point of the  Jurassic Park franchise? 8These two gemstones are essen tially the same, with the colour varying due to di“erent minerals as trace impurities. They are both types of corundum, but there is one name for red ones and another one for those of any other colour.  The red colour comes from the presence of chromium, and this gem™s name comes from the Latin word for ‚red™. There is a theory that the other gem™s name comes from the Sanskrit for ‚Sacred to Saturn™. What are these two gemstones? 9Garnets are silicate minerals that are almost always a deep red in colour. The most famous of these gems is the carbuncle, which has been mentioned many times in the Bible, in a Sherlock Holmes story, by Shakespeare in  Hamlet and a charac ter in the  Final Fantasy series. The name ‚garnet™ comes from the old French words for ‚grain, seed™, be cause they looked like the seeds of a certain fruit. Which fruit™s seeds give the red garnet its name? 10Before huge corporations start ed taking over the diamond mining industry and making it into the billiondollar enterprise it is now, historically diamonds were ac tually found on the surface in allu vial deposits in south India. For a long time, till the 18th century CE ,India was the biggest source of  dia monds. The banks of one particular river in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, were a proli†c area for discovering diamonds. Which river is this that  at one time used to deposit diamonds on its banks? ........................................................................A molecular biologist from Madurai, our quizmaster enjoys trivia and m usic, and is working on a rock ballad called ‚Coffee is a Drink, Kaapi i s an Emotion™. @bertyashley QUIZ Better a diamond with a †aw than a pebble without: Confucius B erty Ashley Answers  1.

There has been more conversa tion within families and at the work place Š such as it is Š on the screen and on the phone, about the dis ease, about the science, about the restrictions, about the vaccine. The daily dump of information from ex perts and nonexperts, the constant ly updating dashboards and track ers, have resulted in a rich archive that future historians of science and public health can plough through to understand what it must have been like to live through these times. And there™s been no shortage of podcasts in what has emerged as an entire genre of pandemic program ming, o“ering advice, analysis and explanation about everything relat ed to COVID19 . The audio series  Pos itive , from which the quotes above are drawn, does something a little bit di“erent; it bears witness. E veryday heroes While the pandemic caused untold su“ering, it also threw up everyday heroes from among our midst, peo ple who went out of their way to ren der help and provide succour  in multiple ways. It also led to the dis covery of pockets of resilience and strength within ordinary folk; the ability to reach out, or to keep it to gether in times of extreme uncer tainty and anxiety.  The six vignettes that make up the series give you, without pream ble or commentary, a glimpse into what it is like to live in the midst  of fear, helplessness, and heartbreak Š and to emerge with a semblance of hope. Ranging from around eight  to 13 minutes, these are †rstperson narrations of people who ﬁsurfed the rough seas of the pandemic... in hospitals, volunteer hubs and within familiesﬂ.  The series is produced by the new digital media startup Newsreel Asia, which launched in May this year. Anupama Chandrasekaran, one of the founders and an audio producer at Newsreel Asia, says, ﬁThe idea was not to be tied down by the limitations of the pandemic but to continue telling stories without travel or studio needs. It was truly a lowcost exercise to produce so mething meaningful and timely in an experimental format.ﬂ Even if you have grown weary of pandemicrelated content, or, hav ing experienced it too closely, wish to put it all behind you, these stories will resonate because of their direct, even terse, simplicity. The format, says Chandrasekaran, ﬁsimply al lowed the people whose story it is to tell it.

We are strict vegetarians and strict teetotallers. But I decided to break the norm and try both nonveg and alcohol and ended up liking both. I mean, nothing was holding me back really except our imaginary entitlements handed down from generation to generation. But there™s a major problem. I tried telling my family, but they were furious. Now, they are arranging my marriage. And most of the women hang up on me when I tell them I occasionally imbibe. Without even wanting to know me as a person. Even when I clarify I am nowhere close to being an alcoholic or carnivorous predator. I would have preferred a love marriage, but unfortunately it didn™t happen and maybe now I am too old. I am in my early 30s. How do I tackle all this? Should I stay unmarried?  ŠSingle and Anxious  to Date Dear SAD,  Fran kly, dear boy, your family is sounding strictly boring. But †rst things †rst. Why are your parents still worrying about what you are eating and drinking? They should have stopped thinking about it once they weaned you o“ Cerelac and started you on pappusaadam.  The fact that they are still watering you and watching you grow makes me strongly believe that they think you are a potted plant. And, as you are well aware, potted plants cannot happily drink alcohol and eat chicken 65. They will soon wilt. Wilting is not good condition for plants. Or men.  How to convince them that you are grownup adult male of species Homo sapiens ? Well, for starters, you could behave like one. For example, move out of your climatecontrolled, vermicomposted little ‘owerpot and start living alone. After the initial shock of seeing you feeding and cleaning yourself, your folks will probably come to terms with it and stop stu’ng plant food down your gullet.  Mind you, they might also go into deep shock. In which case, a small shot of brandy is highly recommended. There are two advantages to this. One, of course, they might actually come out of their shock. Second, they might like it so much they will want to carry on drinking. In which case, you can move back into their house.  Ialso suspect it is your parents who are writing your  matrimonial pro†le in which they are saying tall, fair descendant of god is looking for hardworking apsara with good salary and sambhar skills. This kind of ad works very well when you are looking for pest control service but not for future wife. I think those women are probably calling you just for the pleasure of hanging up.  AJC Bose said even potted plants are sentient, so maybe you can write ad yourself? Try this: ‚Smart guy, loves cooking, will change nappies.™ Or: ‚Smart guy, loves cooking, says sorry.™ After this, you can add anything Š ‚Alcoholic with squint eyes.™ ‚Omnivore with blue beard™. It will cease to matter.  Oh and don™t forget. You must cunningly insert the word ‚broadminded™ somewhere. It is an umbrella hint to prospective bride which basically covers all bases Š boy drinks, boy is divorced, boy murdered †rst wife, boy is unemployed, boy is carnivorous predator, etc. etc.  It takes care of all the preliminary chitchat that in olden days used to take place over co“eebajjimysorepak. Once you do this, most probably when the women call you, they will simply ask, ﬁOkay, what time you start every evening?ﬂ Which is a simple question even you can answer without preparation.

Despite spending  most of my growingup years in Dadar, the hub of Mum bai™s middleclass Mah arashtrian and Gujarati communities, I™ve never fully under stood their shared concept of  farali foods. This unique and ancient idea of ‚fasting foods™ Š brought into play  especially during the monsoon month of  Shravan in the Hindu calendar Š has always seemed like an  oxy moron to me. While people fast, they are allowed to consume a whole pantry of products, from the po tato (my favourite thing, ever) to sabudana or sa go (my food version of abête noire). In un limited  quanti ties to boot! Living with a mother whose love for sabudana in all forms knows no bounds, be it in a peanutladen khichdi or the deepfried sabudana vada, I™ve learnt to reluctantly toler ate  this tablespace usurper over the years. Never having much inter est in knowing more about these clumpy, chalktasting globules, it was only recently that I learnt how they are made .Ifound out with fasci nation that sago is  made by passing the liquid starch extracted from the pith of palm tree stems through a sieve in to boiling water. The resultant tiny, translu cent globules are strained and dried. They are used in a whole host of prepa rations, not just in In dia but around the world too. From the very British sago milk pudding that™s quite similar to aTamil javvarisi payasam, to pem pek, a savoury Indonesian †sh cake, the tiny globules are omnipresent. And greatly loved. S ap and scrape The similarly processed, largersized chewy tapioca pearls  called boba are the main components of the insane ly popular bubble tea. This rather photogenic  drink (ideal for sel†es!) originated in Taiwan in the 80s, and initially  used pearls made from the starch of the cassava, a tropical shrub known for its starchy roots. In terestingly, cassava was introduced in Taiwan from South America dur ing the Japanese colonial rule. The use of tree sap, resin, gum and even bark has been  part of the world™s collective gourmet history since the dawn of mankind. Tree barks like cinnamon and cassia have not just spiced up foods and drinks, but have also served as important in gredients in many a medicinal po tion and unguent thanks to their  antibacterial properties. In fact, Coca Cola, which was invented by  Ameri can pharmacist John Pemberton  as a health tonic in 1886, is strongly al leged to have cinnamon bark as one of its main, highly secret ingredients. Home remedy North of the U.S., in Canada, the xy lem sap of the maple tree has been processed into the amberhued ma ple syrup for centuries now. First discovered by the indigenous First Nations people of Canada, it is their veritable version of liquid gold. The thin, colourless sap is tapped from a variety of maple trees,  from the red, black and sugar genus, col lected via a mesh of connected plas tic tubes, and then boiled down on site in  aptly named ‚sugar shack™ processing units to a luxuriously vis cous syrup consistency. This sweet treat tops everything from breakfast staples like wa“es, pancakes and French toast to even plain old pa rathas Š the latter trend I  lay claim to starting, after a rather serendipitous accident as a child. Natural coolant Speaking of  childhood, my happiest moments were whenever any wo man in the family had  a new baby. Not because I loved babies , but be cause I would always be indulgently slipped a piece or two of the acacia tree gumenriched gond  laddoo. Acacia tree gond is legendary as a healthy home remedy to boost  lacta tion in new mothers and also as a general energy booster. The slightly crunchy, rock sugar like bite of the gond granules pro vides an interesting texture, if a tad ‘avour bereft, when combined with other laddoo ingredients like ghee, dried coconut ‘akes and jaggery. The Memoni Muslim community has its own gondbased preparation, but in a porridge form called ‚aatha™, and also uses the cooling poppy seeds.Similar to gond, but attributed to the sweet almond tree, is badam pi sin. This almond gum is a natural coolant and has jellylike properties that give texture and taste to drinks like jigarthanda. The temple city of Madurai is famous for this cooling drink, which literally means ﬁcool heartﬂ, and is basically the sum of its badam pisin, nannari (sarsaparilla) syrup, chilled milk, sugar and ice cream parts. Another commonlyused tree sap derivative is mastic Š  a fragrant resin from the mastic tree. Traditionally produced on the Greek island of Chios in the northern Aegean Sea, mastic is  an important chewing gum additive. Greek and other eastern Mediterranean cuisines are full of sweet dishes like baklava, loukoumi (Turkish delight), and the stretchy Turkish ice cream called dondurma all ‘avoured with mastic. Ironically, mastic is derived from the Greek  mastichein,  which is the source of the English verb ‚to masti cate™. Now, that™s something to chew on! ........................................................................The Mumbaibased writer and restaurant reviewer is passionate a bout food, travel and luxury, not n ecessarily in that order.

VELANKANNI RAJ, WIKI COMMONS, REUTERS & GETTY IMAGES/ ISTOCK CMYKNDX DELHITHE HINDU MagazineSunday,July11,2021 8BACK PAGE Oh god, it™s a page tur ner!ﬂ That was the cry from various family members on reading the †rst draft of Feisal Alkazi™s family memoirs  published earlier this year. Titled  Enter Stage Right Š The Alkazi/Padamsee Family Memoir  (Speaking Tiger, 2021), it is an irresistible, exciting read. The narrative details are gripping, the pace exciting, and viewing the times described in the book of the two fa milies in pre and postIndepen dence India through the lens of Fei sal allows us to enter a world that we can relate to from stories that our pa rents and grandparents told us of the times they lived through. L egendary names Both names are legendary; the Alka zi and Padamsee clans contributed hugely to the formation and recogni tion of modernism in both Indian theatre and art. It all started when Bobby, or Sultan, Padamsee, the el dest Padamsee brother Š the two fa milies had 17 siblings between them, several of whom would distinguish themselves in theatre and the arts Š had to return to Bombay after just six months as a student at Oxford due to the outbreak of World War II. What followed was a period of crea tive e“orescence as Bobby penned more than 100 poems, drew, painted watercolours and, one day in 1943, gathered a group of keen college stu dents around his mother, the Pa damsee matriarch Kulsumbai™s, hor seshoeshaped dinner table weighed down with mouthwatering Khoja cuisine. Bobby announced a plan to launch their own theatre group, the aptly named Theatre Group, as an al ternative to commercial theatre, in spired by the group theatre move ment of 1930s™ New York. One of those in attendance at that dinner was the young Ebrahim Alkazi. Human angle The group would ‘ourish over the next few years, and court controver sy with productions like an adapta tion of Oscar Wilde™s  Salomé, in which Bobby™s 19yearold sister, Roshen, performed the risqué dance of the seven veils. Bobby would die by suicide aged just 24 in 1946, but the group went on, reaching its ze nith in the coming decades, and three of his disciples married his sis ters to found a cosmopolitan clan Š including Ebrahim, who married Roshen. These were heady times of enormous intermingling, set in the dying days of the Raj and the dawn of Nehruvian India. The search for a new way of living creatively through arich cultural life that was looking for a unique national identity  drew in a very intense and closeknit com munity and family theatre with a ga laxy of close friendships between authors, poets, painters, musicians and actors. As Feisal  comments in the memoir, ﬁGoing to London to gether in 1947, there was a Roman Catholic like [F.N.] Souza, a Muslim like my dad, a Jew like Nissim Eze kiel,  great friends like Krishna Pai gankar and Akbar Padamsee, the idea that they were from di’erent communities was not in anybody™s mind at all– we were always in and out of each other™s houses as well, in my family it was all the artists as well as the theatre people. We grew up with that Š it gives a human angle to all these great giants that art histor ians write about.ﬂ After training at the Royal Acade my of Dramatic Art in London in 1947, Ebrahim returned home and rejoined Theatre Group. However, following a rift with others in the group, he left and founded his own Theatre Unit company at the Bhulab hai Desai Memorial Institute in the 1950s. The Institute played an  im portant role in nurturing modern In dian art and drama, and Ebrahim found a space for uninhibited crea tivity there, before he moved to Del hi in 1962 to head the National School of Drama for 15 years. Over the years, his contribution to widen ing the scope, subject matter and au dience for Indian theatre would be extraordinary, as would those of his brotherinlaw Alyque Padamsee, Mahesh Elkunchwar, and Safdar Hashmi. Alyque, known for direct ing productions ranging from the English version of Girish Karnad™s Tughlaq to  Jesus Christ Superstar , has also been called the father of Indian advertising, and played Jinnah in Ri chard Attenborough™s  Gandhi . His †rst wife was Pearl Padamsee, a stage and †lm actor, director Š her oeuvre included  Godspell , the †rst big musical produced in Mumbai Š and producer. Their daughter, Raell Padamsee, runs her own production house, ACE, in Mumbai. Home to stage The rich family legacy also conti nues through Ebrahim™s son Feisal, who started devising plays with friends in Barry John™s Music Theatre Workshop in the early 80s. Although theatre is his †rst love, Fei sal wears many hats Š theatre and te levision director, author, education ist, counsellor, †lmmaker and founder of Ruchika Theatre. His works include  Noor , a sympathetic, gendered lens on  Noor Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal;  A Quiet Desire, the story of Rabindranath Tagore and of his brother and sisterinlaw  Kadam bari; the adaptation of Kipling™s  The Jungle Book into acomingofage sto ry, retitled  Yeh Bhi Jungle, Woh Bhi Jungle , in whichthe character Mow gli epitomises every important tran sition of adolescence in his search for identity. Along with his sister, Amal Alla na, and her husband, Nissar Allana, Feisal  has strongly believed in the mixing of generations in creative work. ﬁI make it a point that the infu sion of the next generation in all the years of Ruchika is so crucial. All our kids are there and the people who started it... to keep the generations going and learning from each other.ﬂ Radhika, Feisal™s wife, an accom plished actress and arts educator, says,  ﬁIt was so new to me, this world Š in the family, in the home, in the drawing room Š your furniture would be on stage, your clothes would be on the stage.ﬂ When Zohra Sehgal worked with Feisal in the Rus kin Bond serial  Rusty , she found her self wearing a costume that was from Radhika™s trousseau. Feisal recalls her saying,  ﬁHamare gharon mein aise hi chalta haiﬂ (This is how it is in our homes). The story of these two families, who played such a vital role in the history of theatre and art, is an im perative chapter in the country™s so ciocultural history. ........................................................................The writer is a Delhibased artist, a rts educator, curator and researcher.
