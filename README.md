Pat for o†cials ﬁI am happy to note that the devastating wave of CO- VID-19 has abated to an ex- tent and the case positive ra- tio has fallen to 3.36%. But we should be on the guard until the vaccination process is over. I appreciate the ef- forts of the administration and thank all the District Col- lectors for the wonderful work they have done. The entire administration, from the Collector down to the re- venue and police personnel, and ASHA workers, has done well. The multiple strategies we have adopted, including imposition of partial curfew from May 5 and door-to-door fever surveys, have yielded good results,ﬂ said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy during the weekly review of the Spanda- na programme held on Tues- day with all District Collec- tors, Superintendents of Police and other heads of departments. Reiterating that one had to live with COVID-19, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the go- vernment would ensure that everyone was vaccinated. He also said that the fever sur- vey should be continued un- der the supervision of the Joint Collectors and ‚104™ hel- pline should be continued. ﬁEnsure that Rt-PCR tests are continued as these are gold standard tests to identi- fy positive cases. I also direct the Collectors to ensure that all COVID-19 designated hos- pitals are supervised and all facilities, including quality of food, availability of oxygen and sanitation, are moni- tored and a review held for every 15 days,ﬂ he said. He further said that CO- VID-19 services were o†ered at 322 hospitals, where 4,592 ICU beds and 3,196 nNon- ICU beds were available. There were 15,309 oxygen beds available. He also di- rected that all the hospitals be covered with CCTV network. Paediatric wards ﬁWe are not sure whether there will be a third wave, and we are also not sure of its e†ect on children. But we should remain on high alert and not let the guard down. Special paediatric wards should be set up at all the teaching hospitals. We are setting up 10 Litre oxygen plants at major hospitals,ﬂ the Chief Minister said. He also asked the Collec- tors to formulate an action plan for the next two months.On vaccination, he said that 1.28 crore people had been vaccinated so far. Of them, 32.58 lakh had re- ceived the jab twice and 96.25 lakh once.  Inoculation of those be- low 45 years could start if the process for those above 45 years was completed.  The Chief Minister also said that 16 teaching hospi- tals were being set up and in- centives being given to priv- ate establishments who were willing to invest in the State. E-cropping Mr. Jagan also spoke on agri- culture and asked the o“- cials to focus on e-cropping, which could provide a one- stop solution to the pro- blems faced in input subsidy, insurance, procurement and crop loans. He said that ev- ery cop was being geo-fenced. ﬁWe are celebrating July 8 as Farmers™ Day, and Rythu Bharosa Chaitanya Yatras will be held from July 9. I am directing the Agriculture De- partment to take action against those selling fake seeds and ensure loans are disbursed to tenant farm- ers,ﬂ he said.

RAJU Staff Reporter VIJAYAWADA Senior judge and former Chairman of the Appellate Tribunal for Forfeited Pro- perty Justice Jasti Eswara Prasad (87) passed away on Tuesday .  Born on August 4 ,1934, Justice Eswara Prasad grad- uated from the Madras and the Andhra Universities. He completed his BA from Vivekananda College, Ma- dras, and completed LLB from the Osmania Universi- ty in Hyderabad. He en- rolled as an advocate of the High Court of Andhra Pra- desh in 1959. He built up a lucrative practise both in the High Courts as well as in the Supreme Court, par- ticularly in the Constitu- tional, Civil and Taxation matters.  He handled several im- portant cases in which landmark judgments were rendered. After practising for 31 years, he was elevat- ed to the Bench of Andhra Pradesh High Court in March 1990. He held the position of the Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court from March 1990 to April 1994.  Subsequently, he held the position of Judge of the Karnataka High Court from April 1994 till his retire- ment in August 1996.  In January, 1997 he was appointed as Chairman of the Special Court under the Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing Prohibition Act and remained in that posi- tion till he was called upon by the Chief Justice of India to accept the Chairman- ship of a National Tribunal. Justice Eswara  Prasad dead Staff Reporter  GUNTURChairman of the Public Ac- counts Committee (PAC) Payyavula Keshav stated on Tuesday that the TTD should not be brought under the ju- risdiction of the committee, and instead be allowed to function as an independent institution.Addressing the media, Mr. Keshav said that he, in the capacity of PAC Chairman, di†ered with the reported move to bring the hill temple under the committee™s fold, and said that he would speak to the members of the TTD Trust Board and, if required, share his opinion with the Governor. In a terse comment, he said the government™s inter- ference in the functioning of religious bodies was totally unwanted.  ﬁFurther, how far is it fair to gain control or authority over the functioning of reli- gious institutions on the pre- text of rectifying the anoma- lies in the system?ﬂ he questioned.  If the government really desired to supervise the reli- gious bodies, it should bring guidelines for their better functioning, he said.  ﬁOver 100 crore devotees attach great reverence to the Tirumala temple ,ﬂ he added.  Mr. Keshav said there were reports that the TTD board had resolved to bring the temple under the pur- view of the PAC.  ﬁFor this, the resolution should ’rst be sent to the Governor who, in turn, shall give his approval to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Only then the proposal will become a reality,ﬂ he said.

APPSC invites  applications Special Correspondent VIJAYAWADA The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday adjourned to July 8 the hearing on a PIL plea that challenged the creation of the A.P. State De- velopment Corporation (APSDC), for which an ena- bling legislation had been passed in the Assembly last year. Appearing for the State, senior advocate Dushyant Dave and Advocate- General S. Sriram argued that the PIL ’led by Visakhapatnam East MLA V. Ramakrishna Babu was a ploy to stop the banks from funding. Claiming that the APSDC Act, 2020, was one of the most welcome legislations by any State as part of its wel- fare measures, Mr. Dave in- sisted that the petition de- served to be dismissed at the admission stage. He further said that all the monies provided to the cor- poration were through the Consolidated Fund (CF) and by Appropriation Bills. The- refore, the petitioner™s ap- prehensions had no basis, he said.Mr. Ramakrishna Babu™s main contention was that the power given by the APSDC Act to the govern- ment to directly assign its re- venues to the corporation without crediting the same to the CF was in violation of Article 266 of the Constitu- tion. He also challenged the proposed transfer of lands and buildings in Visakhapat- nam district to the APSDC free of cost to provide secur- ity for a ‘25,000-crore loan availed by it.

The Central go- vernment has not ’xed the responsibilities and powers of the board,ﬂ he said.  Though the water levels were below the minimum drawing level, Telangana was unilaterally drawing wa- ters for power generation, he said.  It was a blatant violation of the agreements regarding water sharing, he said. Te- langana was drawing 2 tmcft every day to generate power ignoring the instructions of the KRMB.  ﬁIt is necessary to con- vene an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. Also, it is necessary to lead an all-par- ty delegation to the Centre for a solution,ﬂ he said.

The meeting also pro- posed to form a committee with democratic voices from the two States to prevent further escalation of the dis- pute and work for an amica- ble resolution to the issue based on international and national water sharing trea- ties, which advocate meeting the needs of backward areas within the basin before fo- cusing on meeting the needs outside the basin.

The meeting felt that giv- ing Krishna water to †uo- ride-a“ected areas of com- bined Nalgonda, Rangareddy and drought- prone areas would prevent the †uoride impact on hu- man and animal health be- fore planning its diversion to other areas. The speakers suggested designing of pro- jects without keeping the in- terests of contracts in mind and complete all pending projects at the earliest. Demanding that the State government publish a white paper on the expenditure made as part of utilising the share of river water, the all- party meeting also wanted to know the amount spent on Krishna Basin projects in Te- langana. The speakers also underscored the need to al- lay apprehensions over col- lusion of State and Central Governments and contrac- tors in the matter of irriga- tion projects.  They felt that natural law in river water sharing was that preference should be gi- ven to the basin areas by ap- portioning it based on the proportion of catchment area.  Former MPs G.

Newly appointed State Con- gress chief A. Revanth Reddy spent better part of his day on Tuesday calling on the sulking seniors, who missed the bus to become the TPCC president. An indication of all was not well within the party af- ter Mr. Revanth Reddy™s ele- vation was available as TPCC vice-president Mallu Ravi vi- sited the house of CLP lead- er Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on Tuesday morning. He held brief discussion with Mr. Bhatti, who incidentally is also his brother.  The CLP leader was in the race for the TPCC presi- dent™s post till he was pipped by Mr. Revanth Red- dy, who managed to win the con‘dence of the central leadership. In the last one week, Mr. Revanth Reddy too met all the seniors, who by and large toed the party line and did not make an issue of the new appointments. He consciously avoided meeting party seniors like outgoing chief N. Uttam Ku- mar Reddy, Bhatti Vikramar- ka, T. Jayaprakash Reddy, D. Sridhar Babu and Komati- reddy Venkat Reddy and others. An impression was doing the round that he would not be able to garner the support of the sulking leaders. Nevertheless, he made a attempt to reach out to the party seniors. Accord- ingly, after Dr. Mallu Ravi met Mr. Bhatti, the new TPCC chief called on the lat- ter at his residence. This was followed by visit to the hous- es of Mr. Uttam Kumar Red- dy, Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy and Mr. Sridhar Babu. Dramatically, after Mr. Re- vanth Reddy visited the resi- dences of Mr. Bhatti, Mr. Ut- tam and Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy, leaders began sing- ing unity mantra. Party sources maintained that backroom e“orts were on since the last few days with TPCC vice-president Kusum Kumar, newly elected work- ing president Mahesh Kumar Goud and AICC secretary Sampath Kumar who are un- derstood to have prepared the ground for Mr. Revanth Reddy to meet the leaders, who till the last minute nur- tured hopes of getting the coveted post.

In his bail order, addition- al sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey stated that ﬁconsi- dering the seriousness of evidenceﬂ, the court did not deem it ‘t to release the ac- cused on bail. The judge observed the charge against Mr. Kappan was that he, along with a co- accused, promoted enmity in society and a“ected com- munal harmony.  The court also said dur- ing the course of the investi- gation, incriminating mate- rial was recovered from him, and that he had re- ceived foreign funding for damaging the integrity of the country. The court further said though Mr. Kappan de- scribed himself as a journal- ist, the identity card found on him was that of a news organisation that had wound up its operations in 2018.Mr. Kappan was arrested along with three others on October 4, 2020, at Mant in Mathura district, when they were heading towards Hath- ras village, where a Dalit girl had been allegedly gang- raped and murdered by four upper caste men.

Arjun, a four-and-a-half- year-old elephant calf, was found dead in his enclosure at midnight on Monday. It was only a week ago that another calf, Sreekutty, had succumbed to the infec- tion caused by the herpes vi- rus. Arjun had been rescued by the Forest Department from Mannarkkad in Palak- kad at a young age. Two other calves had been diagnosed with the dis- ease and one more has be- gun to display symptoms. The symptomatic female calf, Podichi, aged six, has been quarantined at the facility. Two-and-a-half-year-old Kannan, whose health had deteriorated during the last few days shortly after testing positive for herpes virus, has shown a slight improve- ment.  However, he is not yet out of danger.  The health condition of the other infected calf, Ame- na, aged one-and-a-half, has remained stable thus far, Thiruvananthapuram Wil- dlife Warden J.R. Ani said. T. Rajeev, Assistant Direc- tor of the Kudappanakunnu Multidisciplinary Veterinary Hospital, who is part of a four-member team consti- tuted to monitor the out- break and treat the infected animals, said Arjun™s health worsened rapidly within a few hours, after showing no symptoms during the last few days. Herpes claims life of another  elephant calf in Kottoor camp Four-and-a-half-year-old Arjun found dead in his enclosure Staff Reporter THIRUVANANTHAPURAM Arjun, the elephant calf that died in Kottoor. Vivekananda H.K., 53, is walking across Karnataka with the aim of ﬁreviving human valuesﬂ. What is unique about his journey is that he is travelling without arupee in his pocket and has vowed not to touch currency, literally. In the last 247 days, he has covered nearly 7,500 km on foot. He has been carrying just a backpack and abottle for water. He has interacted with thousands of people along the way. At night, he sleeps wherever he feels comfortable. He eats whatever is o“ered by the people.  The Hindu met him while he was at Shivapura, near Tarikere, earlier this week. Anative of Hoskote in Bengaluru Rural district, Mr. Vivekananda pursued a postgraduate degree in history, and followed it up with a diploma in journalism and ‘lm production. Then, he began making ad ‘lms.  Meeting people For almost 25 years, he hardly got down from his car. ﬁI was always travelling by car as part of my work. Now, this journey by foot has helped me visit innumerable villages and meet lakhs of people. I have met many interesting people who have been working for the betterment of society in their own way,ﬂ he said. His mother, wife and son reside in Bengaluru. ﬁI gave whatever I had saved to my family, and my mother gets apension,ﬂ said Mr. Vivekananda. He no longer touches currency. ﬁI don™t touch money. If you wish to get me awater bottle, you have to come to a shop and get it for me. Except on few occasions, I have not missed lunch or dinner, thanks to the generosity of people,ﬂ he added.Mr. Vivekananda speaks of truth, honesty and non-violence with the people he meets. If politicians, senior o’cers, journalists, doctors, lawyers and teachers remain true to their conscience, this could be a better world, he said. On an average, he covers 30 km in a day. The long walk, which began at Nagamarapalli in Aurad taluk of Bidar district on November 1, 2020, is expected to end in December this year at Chamarajanagar. He has weathered the cold winter and the hot summer. Now, he is bracing for the heavy rains in Chikkamagaluru and Udupi districts. Social media posts Amidst the lockdown forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, he did not stop walking. He was able to meet friends and well-wishers along the route because of his social media posts.  ﬁI have been active on Facebook and other social media platforms. People who are on my friends™ list are aware of my route. They welcome me and o“er food and water,ﬂ he said.
