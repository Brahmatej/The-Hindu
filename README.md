THE HINDU MONDAY,JULY19,2021 6EDITORIALAfghan™s stability Though the Afghanistan President, Ashraf Ghani, sounds optimistic in the face of grave adversity (Page 1, ﬁTaliban won battles, we will win the war: Ghaniﬂ, July 18), will optimism alone be enough to turn things around in the troubled country? Dependence on foreign aid to quell terrorism has clearly dented the country™s ability to defend itself, and the Taliban, more than anybody else,  knowthis very well.  Whatever the U.S. and its allies have done so far has been undone in one stroke by their sudden withdrawal, leaving the present regime at the mercy of the Taliban .Fundamentalist forces from Pakistan are fomenting trouble, which Islamabad is either unwilling or un ableto control. Pakistan also does not seem to have realised what the growth of fundamentalism can do to a country; it has a great example right next door .India is in a vulnerable position. New Delhi must explore all means to facilitate a lasting solution toensure the neighbourhood™s peace.  Yoganandh T., Salem, Tamil Nadu Punjab politics The Punjab Chief Minister eventually blinked (Page 1, ﬁSidhu may captain Congress in Punjabﬂ, July 18). There will now be  two power centres, probably working at cross purposes and each turning out to the nemesis of the  other. Captain Amarinder Singh may have bought peace to buy time and recalibrate his strategy. One has to consider his good job in governance and a high possibility of his getting reelected being pretty high now being damaged. The Gandhi family according precedence to sycophancy over performance will prove inimical to the Congress party. Deepak Singhal, Noida, Uttar Pradesh Astrology and India Though the writer of the article, ﬁNo pseudoscience, pleaseﬂ (OpEd page, July 15),has tried to make out a strong case against a degree course in astrology, I believe that people™s faith in India is too deeply entrenched for any amount of rationalist thinking to be successful in the real sense. Such beliefs have been in practice for years  when even kings relied on sages for a ﬁpropitious timeﬂ to carry out duties. And our own elected representatives arrange their swearingin  asadvised by  astrologers. Afear of the unknown, fear of divine wrath, societal or peer pressure are probable reasons why there is blind belief in all kinds of rituals and propitiatory ceremonies . These fears are skilfully fuelled by astrologers, especially  inthe rural areas, ensuring a steady income stream for themselves. Education, which is the normally touted panacea for most of society™s ills, is also not a cure! One †nds even educated families immersed in the subject .India needs a  central antisuperstition statute. But given the ideology of the government of the day, such a statute may exist only on paper .V.V. Koushik, ChennainﬁI don™t believe in astrology; I™m Sagitarius and we™re skeptical,ﬂ was what Arthur C. Clarke once said, amply expounding how profoundly we are enwrapped in this truism. In every walk of life the in“uence of astrological predictions, warnings, remedies, etc. are so inextricably entwined that opposing or favouring IGNOU launching a degree course in astrology is of no signi†cance. There is no foreseeable end to the exploitation of the  masses seeking solace from these socalled astrology gurus wielding considerable in“uence on their clients. Any great astrologer, if he is pseudo science™. What is it then™? Does he want it to be called a ‚science™? Yes, there are lakhs of people in India who consult astrologers.  Itworks at a subconscious level. My deep fear is that  ifastrology becomes a discipline of study, it may not be farfetched to say that some government could make it formal for departments to function according to predictions.  M. Gandhi, Puducherry Biomedical waste The acceleration in the statistical rates in the accumulation of  biomedical waste is a serious issue. It calls for adequate disposal measures to save  theenvironment. Rather than use land†lls, proper disposal mechanisms such as incineration and microwave irradiation should be considered even at the district level. Kukku C. Jayamon, Kumarakom, Kottayam, Kerala to bare his conscience ,would admit that all the buildup of astrological analysis is to gain thecon†dence of  anxious seekers .  Vaduvambal Sankaran, BengalurunAs a teenager who avidly loves science, I am shocked by the number of people who supportastrology and a‘liated courses. I wonder whether we will soon have a situation where there will be courses on black magic and witchcraft. There are many who believe in these too.  Ifone reads treatises written on astrology by some of the famous astrologers, one †nds these books lack a proper and honest scienti†c approach . The de†nitions and methods used in these books are vague and lack rigor. I wonder what the IGNOU course will be like.

Although the parliamentarians had gone to the Supreme Court as Mr. Deuba had gathered enough support to be come the Prime Minister of Nepal under Article 76(5) of the C onstitution, President Bidhya Devi Bhan dari refused to entertain it. In stead,the President reappointed K.P. Sharma Oli as the caretaker Prime Minister till the elections that they decided to hold in Octob er and November  2021 were con cluded. This ends now.  Impact of court intervention Amidst such circumstances, the Supreme Court verdict has ended the collusion between  Mr. Oli and Ms. Bhandari to continuously take decisions that were against the provisions of the C onstitution. In December, when the President dissolved  Parliament at the behest of Mr.Oli, the Supreme Court ruled against this order and rein stated  Parliament. The Supreme Court even had a piece of warning for the President to remind her that the o‘ce of the President is also de†ned by the C onstitution and hence, cannot be above it.  On Wednesday, July 14, 2021, Mr.  Oli left his o‘cial residence at Baluwatar which, for the past three and half years,  had become his o‘ce, party headquarters and the centre of power in Nepal com parable to  Narayanhiti Palace dur ing the direct rule of the Kings. He left his residence after addressing the nation in a manner similar to when King Gyanendra left the Na rayanhiti Palace on June 11, 2008. His supporters had a procession .The Oli years In the past, Mr.  Oli™s popularity rose when he challenged India during the blockade in September 2015 and whipped up nationalism to emerge as the leader who could lead Nepal. For the 2017 Federal and Provincial elections, the two major communist parties, the Ne pal Communist Party (Maoist) and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist LeninistŒ UML), joined hands, and with a landslide victory, were to provide a stable government in Nepal in three de cades. This coalition between the two parties had laid out some con ditions, one of which was  that Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda and Mr. Oli were supposed to  ro tate the prime ministership . Even amidst these conditions and party coalitions, for the general Nepali public, Mr. Oli came with many ex pectations. He appointed a tech nocrat Finance Minister, a former Governor of the central bank, and other team members who, in peo ple™s eyes, were perceived to deliv er the goods . Prior to taking over, he held various consultations. In one of the long sessions , he gave the impression that he means bu siness. He had a slogan,  ‚Prosper ous NepalŒHappy Nepali™, that ap pealed to Nepalis both in the country and abroad, giving a feel ing that, perhaps, the great mo ment has arrived for Nepal™s trans formation.  However, the in†ghting within the ruling party that united in May 2018 began to surface in Decem ber 2019. Mr. Oli had, in two years of his rule, ensured that his kitch en cabinet ran the country while his image and international rela tions were being handled by pro minent citizens who kept defend ing him till the end. He unleashed crony capitalism . Many business groups gained from his rule .International relations plum meted with Mr.  Oli taking on India with an amended map of the coun try, which only a’ected  bilateral relations . With the United States Millennium Challenge Corpora tion (MCC) grant not being rati†ed (https://bit.ly/3BhClSs), ties have been hit as far as  U.S. investors are concerned . With China, while he hosted Chinese President Xi Jinp ing during a whirlwind transit stop, the agreements never saw the light of the day when it came to implementation. The complaints of Chinese investors in Nepal in terms of governance and bureauc racy have been no di’erent than the complaints of others.  However, his handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic creat ed a public outcry due to a lack of healthcare facilities. He was per sonally dragged into the Nepal vaccine scam in the purchase of vaccines from the Serum Institute of India. In his swan song, he tried to take credit for the support that Nepal received, which was more due to the goodwill Nepal has and the e’orts of many known and un known activists who ran from pil lar to post in di’erent countries to get support and vaccines  for Nepal.Looking ahead The newly appointed Prime Minis ter, Mr. Deuba, has served as Prime Minister four times but  does not have a great track record. He may have won the  con†dence vote of July 18 ( picture ).  But in this ,there is a great lesson for India to be learnt: on how not to push rela tionships through intelligence agencies and other tacit ways as it fails each time. This has been seen in earlier decades . Indianeeds to continue to build on peopletope ople relationships and engage through o‘cial channels of bilat eral platforms and diplomacy. Let us not forget that  geopolitics is changing as Nepal is now free from being ‚India locked™. Sujeev Shakya is the author of ‚Unleashing Nepal™ and ‚Unleashing The Vajra Œ Nepal™s Journey Between India and China™ A new chapter in Nepal™s quest for political stability The Supreme Court order o†ers some respite amidst the political uncertainty, with lessons for Indian diplomacy  too  AFPB.R. Ambedkar once said, ﬁ... fraternity can be a fact only when there is a nation. With out fraternity, equality and liberty will be no deeper than coats of paint.ﬂ In a  recent comprehensive face toface survey (of nearly 30,000 people) on religious identity, na tionalism and tolerance in Indian society , and conducted in 17 lan guages between late 2019 and ear ly 2020 by the reputed United Statesbased Pew Research Center (https://pewrsr.ch/3xQqlVQ), 85% of Hindus a‘rmed that ﬁrespect ing all religions is very important to being truly Indian.ﬂ But, para doxically, 64% of Hindus think ﬁit is very important to be Hindu to be ‚truly™ Indianﬂ. And 80% among them  say, ﬁit is very important to speak Hindi to be truly Indian ﬂ, giving credence to the slogan of Hindutva. Rather than celebrating tolera tion, or seeing the paradoxes as a peculiarity of the Indic mind, it is crucial to recognise that a virulent majoritarianism can coexist with the professions of tolerance. It is misreading to treat the latter as a paradox because mere toleration or an empirical plurality of cul tures is not the same as a con scious democratic project of multi culturalism or composite culture. Thus, in the last two Lok Sabha elections, not a single Muslim has been elected on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. This obliteration of political representation of a signif icant minority (numbering 200 million) Š which arguably has no parallel in any established democ racy in the world Š has become completely normalis ed in India, and is not a matter of discussion at all.  Other †ndings and paradoxes The Survey abounds in other para doxes: 80% (across all religions, in almost same proportion) think that respecting other religions is a very important part of their own religious identity, 91% assert that they are free to practise their reli gion, 77% of Muslims believe in the Hindu notion of karma, but when it comes to interreligious marriag es, friendships and neig hbours, there is a marked tendency to keep communities separate. Thus, 67% of Hindus and 80% of Mus lims believe it is important to stop women of their communities from marrying outside; 86% of Hindus have their close friends come mainly or entirely from their religion.Scholar Bhikhu Parekh argues that plural cultures have always existed in the past, but what marks out contemporary multicultural societies is the premise of equality of cultures, and not just selfcon tained coexistence.The key fea tures of multiculturalism/compo site culture are, as Prof. Lord Parekh asserts, cultures beyond compartments, constant dialogue and mutual change, and a strong streak of interrogation of ﬁsettled beliefsﬂ across all cultures, espe cially the dominant culture. It is a mistake to see the electo ral success of religious majoritar ianism in recent years as con structed in a vacuum. Instead, it is precisely the decadeslong com partmentalis ation of di’erent reli gious communities, and the ab sence of solid state and civil society arrangements in educa tional pedagogy, personal relation ships, workplace, to facilitate in tercultural interaction, and based on equality and respect, even un der supposedly secular regimes, that has made the soil politically fertile for the demonisation of the minority, especially the Muslim (and occasionally the Sikh, as in the recent farmer protests). This is despite the Survey break ing the Hindutva appellation of the antinational Muslim. In fact ,95% of Muslims (and Sikhs) de clare that they ﬁare very proud to be Indian ﬂ.India™s ‚skyboxi†cation™ The American philosopher Mi chael J. Sandel argued that under rising extreme inequalities of cap italism, there is a ﬁskyboxi†cation of American life ﬂ, in which the af “uent classes and people of poor means have no connection at all, and they ﬁlive and work and shop and play in di’erent placesﬂ and their ﬁchildren go to di’erent schools ﬂ. In India, this plays out di’erently not just in economic terms, but also in religion, and more starkly, caste, the fundamen tal divide. Every religion is riven by caste. Like with religion, 64% say that it is ﬁvery importantﬂ to prevent wo men from crossing caste boundar ies in marriage, and 70% a‘rm that ﬁmost or all of their close friends share their caste ﬂ. Again, the Survey brings to the fore the central contradiction of a demo cratic nation that is divided by compartmentalis ed hierarchies. Thus, it is vital to note that amidst the gathering clouds of majoritar ianism, it is a minority of upper castes that holds the reins of pow er, across religions, and it is the lower castes among the religious minority that face the brunt of ma joritarian attacks. Glossing over this reality, ironically, reinforces religious majoritarianism, and re duces con“icts to merely religion.  This can only be overcome by the unison of social groups, espe cially the oppressed, across, reli gious and caste boundaries. As B.R. Ambedkar recognised a long time ago, the central barrier to the making of a nation is ﬁseparation in social lifeﬂ. It cannot be elimi nated simply by elements like, as the Survey shows, a quarter of Muslims and a third of Christians believing in the purifying power of the Ganga, or the same kind of numbers believing in reincarna tion, etc. The antidote to the fear of other social groups, especially minori ties, often is increased interaction among them in a variety of public and private settings. This is de monstrated in earlier Pew surveys in India, and those elsewhere. In the United States and West Eu rope, there is a big di’erence in positive attitudes towards other social/religious groups when members of those groups are per sonally known. Despite antiMus lim sentiments, much higher num bers than India are willing to accept Muslims as neighbours. In the Pew Survey on 11 Emerging Economies including India (https://pewrsr.ch/2VVyEBV), a higher percentage of the majority community in countries such as Lebanon, Venezuela, and South Africa interact with the minorities than India. Attitudes in South India But contrary voices to the majori tarian and segregated vision can be seen within the present Survey too. In several aspects such as  the superiority of one™s own religion, having friends and neighbours from other religions, preventing interreligious marriages, the im portance of being a Hindu and speaking Hindi to be a true Indian, prohibition of beef, the attitudes in South India di’er, not by a small, but a substantial margin to the rest of India, especially the North and the Central parts. This enhanced willingness to break dif ferences permeates both Hindus and Muslims in the South, showing the wider reinforcing e’ects of in creased mutual interaction. Since culture a’ects politics, Hindu na tionalism has had much less elec toral success in the South, at least so far.  Social reality and complexity cannot be reduced to numbers. Af ter all, one cannot compare atti tudes of di’erent social groups blandly without understanding power di’erences. But quantita tive surveys are still necessary tools. Majoritarianism, accompa nied by mere tolerant acceptance of minority communities as non interacting enclaves, is the death knell of democracy. To the extent that the Pew Survey hints at major itarian attitudes and compartmen talisation, it can only be ignored at our own peril. Nissim Mannathukkaren is with Dalhousie University, Canada, and tweets @nmannathukkaren A ‚tolerant™ India can be majoritarian Mere toleration or empirical plurality of cultures is not the same as a conscious democratic project of multiculturalism Nissim Mannathukkaren GETTY IMAGES/ISTOCKPHOTO Undoubtedly, tra‘cking is a pernicious o’ence, one that societies and governments must have zero tolerance for, and yet, handling the o’ence of tra‘cking needs precision, not a sledgehammer. In its current form, the draft Tra‘cking in Persons (Pre vention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021 seems to be lacking in nuance, even if  well intentioned, to stamp out exploitative tra‘cking. The Bill, which will sho rtly be introduced in  Parliament, aims at preventing and countering tra‘cking in persons, particularly women and children, to provide for care, protection and reha bilitation to the victims, while respecting their rights ,and creating a supportive legal, economic and social environment for them. This is the Bill™s second itera tion; the †rst was passed in the Lok Sabha, in 2018, but then meandered into nothingness as it was never intro duced in the Upper House. Notably, the Bill has expand ed the area under coverage to include o’ences taking place, not only within Indiabut also outside it. It envis ages the setting up of antitra‘cking committees at the State and national levels to implement the provision s, when passed. In the days the Bill was up in the publ ic domain for comments, civil society activists and lega lexperts have criticised its various provisions, and  sub mitted that an overzealous approach would blur the nuances and an understanding of the contributing fac tors, including vicious poverty, debt, lack of opportun ity, and development schemes missing their mark. Vociferous opposition has arisen over the key aspect of handing over investigation in tra‘cking crimes to the NIAboth by those who believe that it would burden the already stretched unit further, and those arguing that this move would be an attack on  federalism , by remov ing local enforcement agencies out of the picture. Another  key criticism of the Bill has been its broad de† nitions of victims, smacking of refusal to consider con sensual sexual activity for commerce. This would onl yland up criminalising sex work and victimisation of the exploited. Bringing pornography into the de†nition o fsexual exploitation would not allow even for any adu lt consumption of nonexploitative, consensual material. Reporting of o’ences has been made mandatory with penalties for nonreporting, but those with an under standing of the tortuous processes, point to the fact that victims often do not want a complaint to be recorded .The mention of the death penalty for various forms o faggravated tra‘cking o’ences needs to be “agged too. The Government would do well to scan and incorporate the responses to its Bill in order to ensure that the fence does not eat the crop. While sexual exploitation and tra‘cking can be ghastly crimes invoking public hor ror, for the s tate to not employ a wholesome approach, cognisant of the causative factors, one that would be sensitive and precise, would be equally horri†c. Sensitive and precise Tra“cking needs a wholesome approach  that is cognisant of the causative factors Two events in Central Asia last week,  which India attended , saw Afghanistan™s neighbours  seeking solutions to the con“ict there. The †rst was a meeting in Dushanbe, of the Contact group on Afghan istan of  SCO Foreign Ministers , and the second, a Cen tral and South Asia connectivity conference in Tash kent. The meetings also took on a special salience d ue to  their timing. Just days after the U.S. and NATO com pleted their pullout from the Bagram  air base, and most other key locations, it is clear that the Taliban are mak ing advances to return to power, by force if necessa ry. Of particular concern are the Taliban™s attacks on b or der posts, particularly the border with Central Asian countries , and the Spin BoldakChaman border with Pakistan , which are for territorial control and to cut o’ crucial supply chains to the government in Kabul . At such a timefor the SCO Ministers™ grouping that in cludes Russia and China, India and Pakistan, and fou rCentral Asian countriesto have issued a joint state ment, albeit without naming the Taliban directly, th at decried the violence by terrorist  groups, was signi† cant. At Tashkent, the host,Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, also gave Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani the opportunity to confront Pakistan Prime Mi nister Imran Khan  for Pakistan™s failure to keep its pro mises on stopping the Taliban from crossing over and ensuring the Taliban conduct peace negotiations in ear nest. Despite Mr. Khan™s protests , the message is that the region, and global players, will not support the Tali ban to enforce its brutal regime in Afghanistan through violent means. For India and the Central Asian S tates, the worries are about the violence at the frontiers  and the resultant refugee in“ux, extremism, and support to transnational groups such as al Qaeda, LeT, JeM , ETIM and IMU, as it happened earlier under  Taliban rule .  As External A’airs Minister S. Jaishankar said, Af ghanistan™s past cannot be its future, and in an inte r view to  The Hindu , Mr. Ghani made it clear that the Af ghan forces will not simply crumble  this time. The emergence of the regional consensus to shun any at tempt to take power by force will also give the Tali ban and its backers in Pakistanreason to pause, and the highlevel intraAfghan talks  in Doha over the weekend, and the Taliban™s Eid announcement that they will pur sue a political solution ﬁseriouslyﬂ and to assure neigh bours they will not allow Afghan territory to be ﬁus ed against any other countryﬂ may be evidence that the message has been received. As the future of Afghanis tan is decided in the weeks ahead, it is necessary for the neighbourhood™s voice,  Central and South Asia includ ed, to emerge more unitedand determined to protect the gains the nation has made over two decades. Leaving the past behind Afghanistan™s neighbours must help it protect the democratic gains of the last two decades

THE HINDU VISAKHAPATNAM
MONDAY,JULY19,2021 7OPEDThe Joint Parliamentary Committee have not been able as yet to make up their minds about the future status of the Indians in East Africa. The matter has been very fully dis cussed in all its aspects at successive meet ings. The opinions of the India O†ce and the Colonial O†ce have been heard ﬁin extns.ﬂ and the views of several persons who are supposed to have special acquaintance with the subject have been ascertained. Members of the Committee have been circulating memoranda to one another, adumbrating more or less contradictory recommenda tions, but the features of a satisfactory solu tion of the problem have not yet emerged. It may be stated, however, that generally speaking the prevailing view of the Commit tee is more favourable to the claims of the In dian community than to the pretensions of the white minority. This was to be expected of a body which is charged with the Parlia mentary oversight of Indian a“airs. But the o†cial view is that this question involves Im perial issues which cannot be determined from a sectional standpoint.  AHUNDRED YEARS AGO  JULY 19, 1921 The East African Problem Data showthat as of now 26.2%  of the world population has received at least one dose of a COVID19  vaccine. Of them, only 1%live in lowincome countries. By contrast, the richer na tions, such as the U.S., Canada, Ger many and Britain, registered above 50% vaccination by July 17. For India, the percentage of the adult popula tion that has received at least one dose stands at 34.1% as of July 18 .How long it will take to eliminate the inequality in the administration of vaccines is shrouded in mystery. Till that happens, long or short lock downs from time to time will remain the only defence against the virus. Several researchers have studied  thee“ectiveness of the lockdowns in economic terms. It is important, the refore, to take stock of the issues that have materialised in this context. Atrilemma  TheEconomist has come up with a paradox of sorts in an article con cerning the tradeo“ between lives and livelihoods. The article  is rooted in the COVID19 disaster and ques tions the practicability or even desir ability of simultaneously protecting lives and livelihoods with the aid of lockdowns. The discipline of eco nomics, or its dominant school at least, is intimately linked to trade o“s and its fundamental teaching is that one cannot have one™s cake and eat it too. During  pandemicdriven lockdowns , this boils down not to a dilemma but a trilemma perhaps. Draconian lockdowns help you to keep on living, but they prevent you from earning a living. With incomes drying up , essential expenditures such as those on food, health and education cannot be sustained, im plying that life  cannot be lived. Ex treme lockdown policies imply  that you cannot quite have your life and live it too Š at least not meaningfully. The vicious trilemma needs to be torn down if humanity is to be pre served. This calls for a careful assess ment of the severity of lockdowns, their costs, and the resulting gains they hopefully lead to in terms of lives saved. If the expected bene‘t of apolicy falls short of cost, econo mists will reject it and suggest the adoption of alternative policies, in volving an excess of bene‘ts over costs. In other words, one needs to understand  the nature of the trade o“. Is the su“ering caused by a lock down su†ciently compensated for in terms of lives saved? The question is probably less sim ple than it appears to be at ‘rst sight. The New York Governor, Andrew Cu omo, said , ﬁTo me, I say the cost of a human life is priceless.ﬂ In technical economic language, this amounts to asserting that the (monetary)  price of ahuman life is in‘nitely high. If this be so, saving a life calls for endless sa cri‘ce. If such sacri‘ce assumes the form of extreme lockdowns, then the line of argument precipitates the tri lemma all over again. It is counter productive to start o“ with in‘nity. Clearly, the Governor had failed to come up with a meaningful de‘ni tion of the value of a human life. Let us push aside this question for now and estimate instead the cost of alockdown. Some researchers be lieve this can be measured by the va lue of lost GDP.  The Economist  qu otes the case of two European countries Š France and Italy. Both imposed heavy lockdowns and suf fered 3%  shrinkage in GDP. Not that people did not die, but the 3%  shrin kage cost of keeping a number of pe ople alive was not insigni‘cant. Simi larly, Finland, which experienced a negligible rise in the mortality rate, experienced a 1%  fall in per capita GDP. On the other hand, Lithuania performed miserably on its death rate front, but its GDP per person is expected to rise by 2%.  The Econo mist  points out yet another horrify ing estimate of the cost of saving CO VID19 infected lives. Research, it says, has established that for every infected person cured in poorer countries, 1.76 children die on ac count of a fall in the quality of life, which is not enviably high even in the absence of lockdowns. This is worse than the trilemma scenario outlined earlier. There are other costs too that should not be overlooked. The hor rors faced by migrant labourers in In dia will continue to jolt our collective memory. One wonders also if life ex pectancy itself has not been adverse ly a“ected in poor as well as emerg ing economies. Children are held back from school. One cannot rule out the emergence of child labour either. If and when the pandemic takes leave, researchers will surely address the child labour question in India caught in the iron grip of COVID19. The bene‘ts of a lockdown, seen in isolation, do not appear to be all that clear. Lockdowns Š severe or mild Š prevent the spread of the dis ease so long as they  last. Mortality falls perhaps, only to resurface once the lockdown is lifted. For the U.S., a researcher has  come up with the dis appointing conclusion that there is no lifesaving impact of lockdowns at all.How, then, should the bene‘t of a lockdown be computed? However absurd this may sound, the question takes us back to the value of a human life, which the New York Governor had calculated more emotionally than he should have only to end up in a paradox. Interestingly enough, a good deal of theoretical and empiri cal research has been done by econo mists on this issue for the past 50 years at least. The pandemic has merely generated new interest in the subject. The value of a human life  There are many di“erent ways in which the value of a human life may be calculated. A straightforward method is to study the life insurance premiums people are willing to pay to ensure proper treatment if a’ict ed by fatal diseases. In rich societies, large amounts will be paid. This could well be used to compute the social bene‘ts of lockdowns, which will probably have higher values in rich societies than in poor societies where few are covered by life insu rance. Further, all lives cannot com mand the same value. It is not crimi nal to ask if an aged person™s life has the same value as that of a younger person. This means that a person™s own valuation of his life may well di“er from the way policymakers are likely to value it. Consequently, the social bene‘t of lockdowns conti nues to be a puzzle. This is not to suggest that lock downs ought to be avoided. Quite clearly, they are unavoidable for now, but they need to be carefully designed, guided by tradeo“s bet ween harsh and mild policies. Or else, the damaged economies of the world will not revive too soon. Dipankar Dasgupta is former professor of Economics, Indian Statistical Institute Lockdowns need to be guided by tradeo†s between harsh and mild policies Migrant workers in search of work in New Delhi.  SUSHIL KUMAR VERMA  Calculating the bene“ts of lockdowns Dipankar Dasgupta Last Saturday, we had readers discuss va rious aspects of news coverage, editorial choices and visual elements at  The Hindu ™s virtual Open House. One of the suggestions was to reimagine the newspaper for the next generation of readers. There were intense discussions about how to provide credible information and indepth analysis for a small device such as a mobile phone. As a news ombudsman, I have one non negotiable condition. Reaching out to newer generations is a logical necessity. According to the online reference section of Britannica, India™s population is young: ﬁIts birth and death rates are both near the global average. More than half the population is under age 30 and less than onefourth is age 45 or ol der.ﬂ Many newsrooms,  The Hindu included,keep debating on what should be the right wordage and mix of visuals and words for va rious devices. In my view, these essential ele ments seem to be external factors. The core internal and intrinsic requirement for a news organisation is its ability to foster humanity. Rise in online hate speech The spread of social media has contributed to a substantial rise in hate speechrelated violence. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) has documented the spike in violence that is directly attributed to online hate speech. It says  users™ experiences online were originally designed to maximise their engagement. However, with an increase in algorithmmediated customisation, there is promotion of extreme content. An investiga tion in  The Wall Street Journal , ﬁHow You Tube Drives People to the Internet™s Darkest Cornersﬂ, was on how the  site often recom mends divisive or misleading material. A re port in CFR recorded that in many ways, the debates  in courts, legislatures, and among the public about how to reconcile the com peting values of free expression and nondis crimination have been around for a century or longer. It is this context that we need credible me dia outlets that can halt the spread of hate, vitriol and misogyny and once again work to wards an inclusive public sphere. Though no one has quanti‘ed the cost of hate that is generated by social media, we are able to sense its corrosive e“ect on social harmony. Acredible news media has two major func tions: bearing witness and making sense. The growth of toxicity on social media has delegitimised the act of bearing witness. The recording of  pain, the poignancy of loss, and the space for democratic aspirations are  ‘l tered through a narrow partisan lens. The photojournalist who bore witness Nothing illustrates this inhuman delegitimi sation of bearing witness than the racist campaign on social media against photojour nalist Danish Siddiqui who was killed while doing his job of documenting the newly emerging politicomilitary situation in Af ghanistan. Siddiqui, a Pulitzer Prizewinning Indian photojournalist, was working for Reu ters. According to the news agency, he was embedded with a convoy of Afghan forces that was ambushed by Taliban militants near akey border post with Pakistan.

Panneerselvan FROM THE READERS™ EDITOR CC CCDATA POINT  This July marks the 30th  anniversary of the economic reforms launched by the Narasimha Rao government in 1991. Evaluations, mainly celebrato ry, have appeared in the media. A dis passionate assessment would be ap propriate as the economic policy changes of 1991 were the ‘rst major changes in the policy regime since the 1950s. The hallmarks of the re forms were lessening of government control and opening the economy to international trade and capital šows.  As the timing of the reforms was determined by a balance of payments crisis, it would be natural to assess the reforms in terms of their conse quence for this aspect of the econo my. In mid1991, India had foreign ex change reserves that would barely ‘nance three weeks™ imports. In mid2021, the import cover is esti mated at well over 12 months. Fur thermore, in the three decades since 1991 there has not been a balance of payments crisis. On the other hand, in the preceding three there had been several. This marks a signi‘cant reversal.  Financial in†ows  Adisappointing feature, though, is that the foreign exchange reserves have accumulated as a result of ‘nan cial inšows rather than export sur pluses, as was expected. It is now ap parent that competitiveness cannot be established by simply reducing go vernment control over the private sector. The history of globally suc cessful economies shows that public ly provided infrastructure, private R&D and a facilitating government machinery are crucial for a country™s export competitiveness. Most of these ingredients have been present in the case of India™s software servic esexporters but are not equally available for exporters of goods. The occasions since 1991 when there has been a trade surplus have been rare. The balance of payments has been shored up by portfolio capital. Such capital can šow out just as easily, leaving reserves to deplete rapidly. The only guarantee against balance of payments stress is a consistently strong export performance. The re forms are yet to take us there. The reforms were also meant to raise the rate of growth of the Indian economy, which they did. Though the acceleration took some time com ing, the rate of growth of the Indian economy has been higher after 2001. However, it started slowing progres sively after the demonetisation of 2016, dropping to less than prere form levels even before we were struck by the pandemic. Since then, output has actually contracted, and there is no certainty on how growth will play out in the immediate future. Much depends upon whether there will be a third COVID19 wave , neces sitating the shutting down of eco nomic activity  yet again. Returning to the question of longterm growth, it needs to be pointed out that its accel eration after the reforms of 1991 was not the ‘rst time it happened. Not only had this occurred before, in the early 1950s and the late 1970s,  but al so the degree of acceleration had been greater then. In 1991, we were, in e“ect, dealing with a cashšow problem, albeit in foreign exchange. Now COVID19 has brought home to us something larg er, the absence from the economy of certain crucial services and the un derlying assets that enable their pro duction. We realised how inadequate our health system is, as we watched helplessly the scramble for oxygen, the overšowing hospital wards and the overburdened crematoria. But our rickety healthcare infrastructure is merely a metaphor for the absent ecosystem for living in India. Sanita tion, transportation, urban gover nance and the producer services, from power supply to waste manage ment, needed to undertake econom ic activity, are all inadequately availa ble. This de‘cit cannot be bridged by legislating changes to the policy re gime as was done in 1991. The neces sary infrastructure would have to be ‘rst created and then managed to supply the stream of services expect ed. We have learned the hard way that the value of an economy de pends on the extent to which it serves our needs. The current crisis of lives and livelihood in India is the time to start building a valuable one.
