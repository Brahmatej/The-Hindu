Madhav supporting the deci sion of the Union govern ment on the strategic sale of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP). JAC chairman M. Jaggu Naidu alleged that Mr. Mad hav, who was elected by the graduates of North Andhra, was cheating the people with such statements and demanded his immediate re signation as an MLC. His statements were making a mockery of the agitation be ing organised by steel work ers, trade unions and peo ple™s organisation for the last six months, Mr. Jaggu Naidu said.  He demanded that the MLC take back his state ments and seek an apology from people. Mr. Jaggu Naidu said that the privatisation of the VSP would deprive the youth of their employment chances, hinder the progress of the ci ty and also betray social jus tice.  Mr. Madhav should be the voice of the people in the council as an elected repre sentative, but his remarks were an insult to people, Mr. Jaggu Naidu said. JAC vice chairman P.

 Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Committee chairman D. Adinarayana has said that the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) was established following widespread prot ests by people against the decision of the then Central government to set up the steel plant elsewhere in the country. Mr. Adinarayana was ad dressing steel workers, who participated in the 169th day of the relay hunger strike at the steel plant arch at Kur mannapalem here on Fri day.  The Centre had, however, delayed the construction of the plant, which resulted in the VSP accumulating losses over the years, he said. The government had made plans to refer it to the BIFR (Board for Industrial and Fi nancial Reconstruction) in the past and hand it over to some corporate groups, he added.In the subsequent years, attempts were made to div est the stakes in the plant in the name of going for an In itial Public O‘ering(IPO). Several attempts were made by the government over the years to sell the plant but they could not materialise due to united struggles by the workers and employees, Mr. Adinarayana said. Committee leader B. Ma hesh and member Paranda mayya called upon the workers not to get dishear tened by the moves of the Union government but to continue the struggles unit edly to stop the government from going ahead with the privatisation of the steel plant.

 The pandemic may have changed the face of educa tion to the virtual mode, but not all children have the good fortune of having ac cess to online classes, partic ularly the underprivileged. Additionally, several Child Care Institutions that pro vide support to children from economically back ward families are battling a steep “nancial crisis with do nation funds drying out. With an objective to bridge this divide, citybased NGO HUManity Œ led by a team of young volunteers Œ initiated three projects and a campaign called ‚Donate a Device.™ Founded by Chana kya Karra and Abhishek Pa luri in 2019, HUManity is cur rently associated with “ve Child Care Institutions (CCI) in Visakhapatnam, connect ing 150 children through the e‘orts of the organisation™s 50 volunteers. ﬁOwing to the pandemic, there has been a dip of 80% in the donations resulting in asevere crisis among the CCIs,ﬂ says Mr. Chanakya, who completed his masters in technology from Andhra University before joining the social sector. As part of the e‘orts of the organisation, HUManity has initiated a ‚Donate a Device™ campaign to distribute donated mobile phones that can serve the purpose of online education for the kids at the CCIs. Three projects The organisation also initiat ed three projects to engage with the kids at the CCIs at the education level by pro viding free teaching classes in English and mathematics on weekends; start a life skill programme to improve cog nitive and interpersonal skills of the children and build a library in each of these “ve Child Care Institu tions through a collaboration with Harper Collins. ﬁOne of the main challenges that we have observed at these CCIs is that most children after they step out of the institu tion do not have the skill sets to sustain themselves. We plan to start systematic skill enhancement programmes at the “ve CCIs to address this issue,ﬂ says Mr. Chanakya.

THE HINDU SATURDAY,JULY31,2021 8EDITORIALIntentional act The murder of an Additional Sessions judge in Dhanbad in broad daylight strikes at the root of democracy (Page 1, July 30 ).It is another instance of judicial o†cers facing grave threats, attacks and allurements for handling cases with political dimensions or wider rami“cations. It is an irony that security for  judicial o†cers is unsatisfactory and that they have to rely on the executive and law enforcement machinery. V. Johan Dhanakumar, ChennainThe citizen™s last bastion of hope rests with the judiciary. The role of judges is even more crucial in the India of today. The incident is athreat to the independence of our judiciary. If we cannot protect our judges, then how can we protect our democracy? Pankhuri Kaushik, Karnal, Haryana nThe main blame for failure of justice lies with the illegal and impermissible political pressure on investigation and prosecution. Press reports point to such possibilities in the present case also. Is it whither our law and order system? The only solace this time is the suo motu intervention by the higher judiciary. P.R.V.

To read more letters online, scan the QR code A. Faizur Rahman In what has been widely per ceived as a gesture of concilia tion towards Muslims, the Rash triya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said in a re cent speech (https:// bit.ly/3j2Oe6t) that Hindus lynch ing minorities for cow slaughter were acting against Hindutva, and those asserting that Muslims have no place in India were not Hindus. He also tried to allay Muslim fears about the bleak future of Islam in India saying the religion was not in danger, and asked Muslims to help the RSS in making the country a world leader ( vishwaguru ) on the basis of the fact that all Indians, being the descendants of common ancestors from the last 40,000 years, have the same DNA. The viewpoints Muslim opinion makers either brushed o‘ Mr. Bhagwat™s remarks as ﬁmere rhetoricﬂ because ﬁRSS leaders often spoke with a forked tongueﬂ, or tried to mollify him by saying that ﬁif there is someone who can initiate perestroika in the RSS, it is Bhagwatﬂ because, ﬁin a gradual manner he has been try ing to change the Sangh™s attitude towards Muslims ﬂ.If the untenability of the “rst viewpoint is based on a dismissive distrust of the RSS, the second amounts to nothing more than complaisant backslapping. Such facile responses, to say the least, exude an attitude that is not con ducive to a genuine HinduMuslim dialogue the RSS chief hopes to in itiate.  To his credit, the RSS chief spoke with an open mind and wanted the mistrust ( avishwaas )between Hindus and Muslims to be understood and dispelled in an atmosphere of forthright outspo kenness ( khari khari baat ko jaisa hai waisa samajna ). However, communal unity ( ekta ) through such a dialogue was possible only if Muslims acknowledge India as their motherland;accept its tradi tions and culture ( parampara, san skriti ), and honour their common ancestors ( samaan purvaj ).Mr. Bhagwat virtually rendered these three prerequisites a  sine quo non for establishing one™s In dianness with the condescending summation:  baaqi hamaare ya haan sab swatantrata hai (there is freedom for everything else in our land).Amelding This attempt to meld Indianness and Hinduness together is eerily similar to V.D. Savarkar™s credo which de“nes a Hindu as one who regards the entire subcontinent as his fatherland ( pitrubhu );  des cended of Hindu parents, and  considers this land holy ( punyabhu ). For Savarkar these three condi tions signi“ed a common nation (rashtra ), a common race ( jati) and acommon culture ( sanskriti ), res pectively, and together they form the foundation on which Hindutva rests.  Several assertions of Mr. Bhag wat re’ected this attitude. For in stance, his full statement on cow vigilantism was  Hindustan Hindu Rashtra hai, gaumata pujya hai ;  le kin lynching  karne waale yeh Hin dutva ke khilaf jaarahe hain (India is a Hindu nation, the cow is wor thy of worship; but the lynchers are going against Hindutva). He also quoted the RSS founder K.B. Hedgewar as stating that Hin dus were wrong in blaming the British and the Muslims for their pitiable state ( durwasta ) because, despite being the owners ( maalik )of their country, and their large numbers, if Hindus could be re duced to such a state then there must be some shortcoming ( kami)in them that needs to be addressed. This, Mr. Bhagwat said, is how the RSS conceptualises the situa tion and therefore, in its view the minorities are not the reason for the miserable condition of the Hin dus in a Hindu country ( Hinduon ke desh mein ).Portraiture of India Had the Muslim commentators lis tened to Mr. Bhagwat™s 34minute speech made in Ghaziabad Šin stead of relying on selective ver sions of it publicised by the media Šthey would perhaps have chal lenged, in the spirit of the candid ness he suggested, the portraiture of India as indigenously Hindu with a nonnative Muslim population. Nonetheless, was Mr. Bhagwat trying to say that Muslims, even if they are ﬁour own brethrenﬂ ( ha maare apne bhai ) now, are outsid ers?  But he did want the people to know that Islam™s entry into India was aggressive ( woh aakramakon se saath aaya ), but even so, all those who came to our land are still here coexisting peacefully ( hamaare yahaan jojo aaya hai woh aaj bhi maujood hai ).Islam in the subcontinent Mr. Bhagwat should have known that Islam in the subcontinent pre dates the forays of invaders such as Mahmud of Ghazni, Muham mad Ghori, and Muhammad bin Qasim who captured Sindh and Multan from Raja Dahir around 711 CE. It was around 630 CE that Isla mised Arab merchants started ar riving in the coastal regions of KonkanGujarat and Malabar in continuation of the trade links they had with India from preIs lamic times. The cordiality of this transactive relationship was such that it resulted in the spread of Is lamic culture and religion in India.  Thus, most  Indian Muslims to day are the descendants of the lo cals who converted to Islam and, therefore, they have always consi dered India their motherland and respected it traditions, culture, and diversity. The ultimate proof of this patriotism was demonstrat ed when they chose India over Pa kistan after Partition. But it would be unfair to expect this loyalism to be rooted in the subliminal recognition of an au tochthonous Indian race that mag nanimously ﬁaccommodatedﬂ them. For there is no evidence to show that such a race existed in In dia, nor are the Muslims aliens.  Researcher Tony Joseph, in his engrossing book  Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From and subse quent articles, has shown that In dians are a multisource civilisa tion who drawtheir cultural impulses, traditions and practices from a variety of heredities and migration histories. He calls the earliest direct ancestors of people living in India today, the ‚First In dians™. They were the descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who arrived here about 65,000 years ago. The First Indians were later joined by Zagrosian herders from Iran with whom they formed the Harappan civilisation.  After 2000 BCE came the Aryans, the Austroasiatic and Ti betoBurmanlanguage speakers, and, much later, the Greeks, the Jews, the Huns, the Sakas, the Par sis, the Syrians, the Mughals, the Portuguese, the British, the Siddis Šall of whom left small marks all over the subcontinent. In short, says Mr. Joseph, almost all the population groups of India carry 5065% of their ancestry from the First Indians, no matter where in the caste hierarchy they stand, what language they speak, which region they inhabit or what religion they belong to. This being the truth, India can not be spoken of in terms of Hin duon ka desh (Hindu country) or Musalmaanon ka desh (Muslim country). It belongs equally to all communities living here, and as pointed out by the RSS chief him self, India being a democracy can not countenance the dominance of Hindus or Muslims.  Likewise, any HinduMuslim dialogue must be unconditional and take place in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In Mr. Bhag wat™s own words:  Darke maare ek ta hona nahin hai  (Let there not be unity out of fear). A.

There is no gainsaying the truth that we have been examining the Himalaya mainly through the coordinates of geopolitics and se curity while relegating others as either irrelevant or incompatible. In a certain sense, our intellectual concerns over the Himalaya have been  largely shaped by the as sumption of fear, suspicion, rival ry, invasion, encroachment and pugnacity. If during colonial times it was Russophobia, then now it is Sinophobia or Pakistan phobia that in fact determines our con cerns over the  Himalaya. Within the domain of geopolitics and se curity, conceived by that which lies outside the Himalaya, a pro cess that decolonial scholars such as Pauline Hountondji refers to as extroversion. Ironically it is the DelhiBeijingIslamabad triad, and not the mountain  per se , that de “nes our concerns about the Hi malaya. Are we not really leading Himalayan s tudies towards the dead end of violent intellectual pursuits? Anational Himalaya If extroversion in the “eld of know ledge production has resulted in academic dependency, in the case of Himalayan s tudies it has given birth to the political compulsion of territorialising the Himalaya on a par with the imperatives of nation alism. Thus the  attempt to create a national Himalaya by each of the “ve nations (Nepal, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, and Tibet/China)that fall within this transnational landmass called the Himalaya. The National Mission on Himalayan Studies , for example, under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, is a classic case in point that provides funds for research and technologi cal innovations, but creating poli cies only for the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). The Mission docu ment avowedly claims: ﬁThe Go vernment of India has comeup with this Mission in recognition of the fact that the Himalayan Eco system is important for ecological security of India (https:// bit.ly/3x8dOMB)ﬂ. Thus, comes the Indian Himalaya. It reminds us of that ancient parable where a few blind men were trying to fath om how huge an elephant was by touching only the di‘erent parts of its body. By considering cartographic “x ations as the natural limit of scho larship, we have overburdened Hi malayan s tudies with the concerns of States in place of people, cul ture, market or ecology. India™s understanding of the Himalaya is informed by a certain kind of real ism, as the Himalaya continues to remain as a space largely de“ned in terms of sovereign territoriality, in contrast to alternative imagina tions such as  community, ecology or market. It may be perceived that such an alternative concep tualisation of Himalaya is not only possible but also necessary. But can we really work out such an al ternative imagination especially when we “nd territorialisation and securitisation to be the two domi nant modes through which the Hi malaya is imagined both in the o† cial context, and, by extension, in popular discourses.  Ahistorical logjam The Himalaya™s territorialisation bears a colonial legacy which also sets up its postcolonial destiny as played out within the dynamics of nation states. The arbitration of re lationships between and among the “ve nation states falling within the Himalayan landmass has failed to transcend the approach derived from the  given categories of terri toriality, sovereignty and di‘e rence. As such, the fact that the lines of peoplehood and the na tional border, especially within the context of the Himalaya, never coincided, is bound to give birth to tensions while working out pro jects predicated upon national so vereignty. Given this historical log jam, what we can only expect is the escalation of territorial dis putes as the immediate fallout when infrastructure development projects in the border areas are adopted by constituting nation states to secure their respective territories falling within the Hima layan landmass. Borders and their di†erences It needs to be recognised that pol itical borders and cultural borders are not the same thing. Political borders are to be considered as spacemaking strategies of mod ern nationstates that do not ne cessarily coincide with cultural borders. In other words, while a statist imagination has a telling ef fect on the way a border is under stood in political terms, culture in that sense de“es the (political) idea of border or at best considers it as permeable, penetrable, con nective, heterogeneous and one that can be accounted for mainly through dreams, passions, ’ows and livelihoods. The singular sta tist conception of a political bor der would then appear to become a‚polysemic™ or even ‚rhizomatic™ when viewed in cultural terms, and, by extension, in terms of trade and ecology or the environ ment.  It needs to be realised that hu man security cannot be e‘ectively appreciated through the paradigm of sovereign territoriality, alth ough state systems operating with in the Himalaya have failed to de vise any other framework to grapple with the issue of security. More often than not, the state has dominated the agenda of de“ning the domain of nontraditional se curity (such as human rights, cas es of ecological devastation , cli mate change, human tra†cking, migration, forced exodus of peo ple, transnational crime, resource scarcity, and even pandemics) be sides setting the tone of an ap proach to handling traditional se curity threats (such as  military, political and diplomatic con’icts that were considered as threats against the essential values of the state, territorial integrity, and pol itical sovereignty). Interestingly enough, it has often appeared as a fact that the measures to deal with traditional security threats from outside have in fact triggered non traditional insecurities on several fronts on the inside. Understanding the Himalaya Keeping these arguments in order, it is proposed that there could be several alternate ways of reading the geopolitical and the security concerns of the Himalaya and if the statist meaning (territoriality, sovereignty and di‘erence) is pri vileged over and above those of the anthropological, historical, cultural, and ecological ones, it would continue to re’ect a set of mental processes predicated on a certain conception of spatial imag ination that could be anything but ‚unHimalayan™ or, for that matter, antithetical to the very idea of the Himalaya itself. How long should one go on referring to the Hima laya as the one of the largest biodi versity hotspots ? O r as the largest water towerof Asia? Or as a zone that is culturally and linguistically diverse, sharing a common histor ical pool of resources, communi ties, cultures, civilisations and me mories, and susceptible to climate change and ecological vulnerabili ties? When would these terms of references be predicated in our scholarly, and, by extension, ped estrian, attempts to understand the Himalaya and produce impact ful policy research on the Himalaya? The argument is simple. The Hi malaya being a naturally evolved phenomenon should be under stood through frameworks that have grown from within the Hima laya. The Himalaya needs to be vi sualis ed with an open eye and ta ken in as a whole instead of in parts unlike the ancient parable of the e‘orts of the blind men in try ing to  understand the elephant in parts. The Himalaya is  a space whose history de“nes its geogra phy rather than the other way round. Since histories are always made rather than given, we need to be careful about what kind of Himalayan history we are trying to inject or project in the way we imagine the Himalaya. Viewing the Himalaya as a space of political power and, by extension, through the coordinates of nation states epitomising di‘erential national histories is a violent choice, which actually enriched ultrasensitivity towards territorial claims and bor der management.  Aroad map of other routes In contrast to this, if we are ready to consider the Himalaya as a space that is deeply embedded in human subjectivities, we can pos sibly come out of the grip of a na tional absolute space,which is ac tually necessary if we are to address the concerns of trade, commerce, community, ecology and environment Š  issues which are no less important when we are to think of securing livelihoods, cultures and the environment in the Himalaya. In fact, the road map of all these alternative routes Štrade, community, environment Šare located beyond the absolu tist statist position. The need is that these alternative imaginations of security should be given the re quired space in the way policy making, statebuilding strategies and diplomatic relations are worked out in relation to the Hi malaya. The t ime has come when we need to take position between the Himalaya as a national space and as a space of dwelling instead of avoiding our encounter with this ambivalence.  Swatahsiddha Sarkar is Professor and Director, Centre for Himalayan Studies, University of North Bengal, Darjeeling, West Bengal Visualising the Himalaya with other coordinates Looking at it only through the prism of geopolitics and security concerns ignores its other crucial frameworks  Swatahsiddha Sarkar GETTY IMAGES The Supreme Court ruling that legislative privilege cannot be extended to provide legal immunity to criminal acts committed by lawmakers ought to be welcomed for two reasons. It lays down  that legisla tors charged with unruly behaviour that results in of fences under penal laws cannot be protected either by their privilege or their free speech rights. Second,  the decision revivi“es the law relating to a prosecutor™s role in withdrawing an ongoing criminal case. The LDF go vernment in Kerala has su‘ered a setbackas it strongly favoured the withdrawal of cases against six members sought to be prosecuted for creating a ruckus in the  As sembly on March 13, 2015, when they boisterously tried to interrupt the presentation of the Budget presented by the erstwhile UDF regime. Their action resulted in destruction or damage to some items, amounting to a loss of š 2.20 lakh. Based on the Assembly Secretary™s complaint, the police registered a case and later “led a charge sheet against them for committing mischief and trespass under the IPC and destroying public property under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. This  year, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thi ruvananthapuram, had rejected the application by the public prosecutor for withdrawal from prosecution, an order that was later a†rmed by the Kerala HC. It is not surprising that the apex court concurred with these de cisions , as it is indeed an unacceptable argument that the alleged vandalism took place as part of the legi sla tors™ right to protest on the ’oor of the House. Kerala CMPinarayi Vijayan, who has rejected calls for asking his General Education Minister, V. Sivank ut ty, one of the accused, to resign and face trial, mai n tains that the matter ought to have been seen as a polit ical protest and something that should not have been taken into the domain of criminal prosecution. He is in deed right when he says that courts ought not to reap praise a prosecutor™s decision to withdraw a case, a nd that they should only examine whether the prosecutor had applied his mind independently. However, there is equal force in the proposition that it is the court™s duty to decide whether the withdrawal is in good faith, is in the interest of public policy, and is not aimed at thwart ing the process of law. Legislative privilege and pa rlia mentary free speech arenecessary elements of a law maker™s freedom to function, but it is di†cult to disagree with the Court™s conclusion that an alleged act of destroying public property within the House cannot be considered ﬁessentialﬂ for their legislative functions. It is indeed quite legal for Mr. Sivankutty to remain in of “ce, as he is yet to be convicted. However, he will be welladvised to take a cue from several recent prece dents of those in ministerial positions stepping down until their names are cleared by due process. Law and lawmakers SC is right in saying legislative privilege cannot be a cover for crimes in the House The Government hopes to ring in fresh changes to the 1961 Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation law in the monsoon session , after the  Cabinet nod this week. From savers™ perspective, the most signi“cant modi“cation on the anvil is a 90 day deadline for the Corporation (DICGC) to remit th einsured deposits of customers in troubled banks. As per the plan, once the  RBI imposes curbs on a bank, the clock will start ticking and by the 91st day or ther ea bouts, account holders will get their outstanding ba lance back with a cap of š5 lakh. While Finance  Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said this will not  apply retrospec tively, she did indicate that this would apply to cases of lenders already under a moratorium. In the last two years,  Yes Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and the PMC Bank ,have faced such a bar on depositors seeking to with draw. PMC Bank accounts still face such curbs, even as savings parked in other cooperative lenders that ha ve gone undercontinue to elude their rightful owners. The Minister said it normally takes eight to 10 years fo r in sured deposits to be forked out, from the time a ban khits a hurdle and myriad conditions are imposed on withdrawals.  But these delays were wellknown last year too, when the insured deposit amount was raised to š 5 lakh from š1 lakh laid down in 1993. Making incremental changes in quick succession sug gests a piecemeal approach to governance rather than a systemwide view, even though the government stressed it has been working ‚overtime™ to resolve the PMC Bank crisis.  Nevertheless, given the rising distress in households and the downward momentum in sav ings levels due to the pandemic , this change must be al lowed to make it through the din in Parliament. As per RBI data, š76.21 lakh crore or almost 51% of deposits are now insured, but 98.3% of all accounts have balances of š5 lakh or less so they are fully insured. This can  be a source of renewed comfort for people in the banking system, grappling with bad loans, dwindling deposits and a still’edgling insolvency framework. It is imp or tant for “nancial stability that people feel it is s afer to park their money in a bank than stashing it under a mat tress. For several people with limited “nancial lite racy and access to retirement savings instruments, with life time earnings (possibly over š 5 lakh) parked in a neigh bourhood cooperative bank, this would still be a le ss than perfect outcome. The RBIneeds to up its oversight game, and the Centre, which has recently made  the De partment of Cooperation  a fullscale ministry, needs to allow it to do so. Moreover, just as the latest amend ments have an enabling provision to raise the premium paid by banks to the DICGC in future, there should have been one to raise the insured deposit limit in line with in’ation and per capita income trends.

SATURDAY,JULY31,2021 13Pakistan™s National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf met with his American counter part Jake Sullivan in Wash ington, during which the two leaders discussed the urgent need for reduction in vio lence and a ﬁnegotiatedﬂ pol itical settlement in Afghanistan. The talks also covered oth er issues of mutual interest, the  Dawn News reported on Friday. This was the second meet ing between the two leaders who †rst met in Geneva in March. ﬁHad a positive followup meeting with NSA Jake Sulli van today in Washington,ﬂ Mr. Yusuf tweeted in an early morning tweet. ﬁTook stock of progress made since our Geneva meeting and discussed bilat eral, regional and global is sues of mutual interest,ﬂ he said, adding that the two sides ﬁagreed to sustain the momentum in PakU.S. bilat eral cooperationﬂ. Though Mr. Yusuf did not mention Afghanistan among the issues discussed in the meeting, Mr. Sullivan devot ed half of his tweet to the Af ghan issue. ﬁI met with Pakistan™s NSA today to consult on regional connectivity and security, and other areas of mutual cooperation. We discussed the urgent need for a reduc tion in violence in Afghanis tan and a negotiated political settlement to the con“ict,ﬂ Mr. Sullivan said. Since the announcement of the withdrawal of U.S. forces by August 31, violence has been rising in Afghanis tan and e‘orts to broker a peace settlement between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban have slowed. Mr. Blinken, who returned to Washington on Thursday evening after a visit to India and Kuwait, had said during the tour that Pakistan has ﬁa vital role to play in using its in“uence with the Taliban to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by forceﬂ. Diplomatic in†uence Committed to withdrawing all U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) troops from Afghanistan by September 15, the Biden ad ministration is now using its diplomatic in“uence to pre vent a Taliban takeover and that™s where it sees a role for Pakistan, according to the Dawn report. While Pakistan also wants to prevent a military takeov er in Kabul, Prime Minister Imran Khan in an interview to an American channel this week said that the U.S. deci sion to set a timetable for withdrawing troops had nar rowed Islamabad™s options. Mr. Khan, on PBS New sHour,  indicated that the Ta liban see the withdrawal as their victory and are less re ceptive to reconciliation ef forts than they would have been had the timetable not been announced. Mr. Khan also criticised the U.S. for trying to ﬁlook for a military solution in Af ghanistan, when there never was oneﬂ. The Pakistani delegation, which arrived in Washington three days ago, is also busy explaining its position in meetings with senior U.S. of †cials, lawmakers, experts and media representatives. It is not clear if InterServices Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt. Gen Faiz Ha meed, who is also in Wash ington for the talks, attended the meeting between the two NSAs, the report said.

CDC director Rochelle Walenksy cited data from the presentation this week to justify a return to masks for vaccinated people in highrisk areas. One of the biggest takea ways is the †nding that breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are highly contagious, with the data coming from previous stu dies and a new analysis of an outbreak in Provincetown .Experts rely on a number called the cycle threshold (Ct) value to indicate how much virus an infected per son harbours, with lower numbers indicating higher viral load. In Provincetown, there was ﬁno di‘erence in mean Ct values in vaccinat ed and unvaccinated cases,ﬂ the slides said. Areview of †ndings from other countries shows that each person with Delta in fects on average eight oth ers, making it as transmissi ble as chickenpox but still less than measles. Vaccine e’cacy estimates vary across countries, but in its concluding slide, the CDC estimates the risk of severe disease or death is reduced 10fold or greater in the vac cinated, while risk of infec tion is reduced threefold or greater.

Around 20,000 Afghans worked for the U.S. following the 2001 invasion of Afghan istan in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and have applied for evacuation under the State Department™s Special Immi grant Visas program. Some estimates suggest the total number of prospec tive evacuees under what has been dubbed ﬁOperation Allies Refugeﬂ could be as high as 1,00,000 once rela tives are included. Many of them fear retalia tion from the Taliban, which has secured a vast swath of the country since foreign troops began the last stage of awithdrawal due to be com plete by late August. ﬁToday is an important milestone as we continue to ful†ll our promise to the thousands of Afghan nation als who served shoulderto shoulder with American troops and diplomats over the last 20 years in Afghanis tan,ﬂ Mr. Biden said in a statement.
