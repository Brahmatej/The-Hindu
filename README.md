THE HINDU SUNDAY,JULY18,2021 12Volcanoes on Venus Last year, scientists were excited by traces of phosphine in Venus™s atmosphere, because it could imply the presence of life there. This has been displaced by what Cornell University researchers have suggested Œ that there are explosive volcanoes on the surface of Venus that emit phosphides which forms the phosphine. This study, published in  PNAS, suggests that phosphine points not so much to the biology but the geology of Venus.  During pregnancy, the body undergoes many changes, particularly, those driven by hormonal levels and in im mune system function that are intended to stop the mother™s body from reject ing the baby, but increase her vulnerability to viral in fections. As with most SARS CoV2 infections in the gener al population, most infec tions in pregnant women are likely to be asymptomatic or mild, but, particularly dur ing the third trimester, there may be severe complica tions, with some reports stat ing that there is a severalfold increase in pregnant women needing intensive care as compared to infected non pregnant women. Infections in pregnant women have been linked to an increase in preterm births, low birth weight and foetal distress, with a higher mortality rate in motherstobe and their babies. Many of the compli cations are in pregnant wo men who also have other co morbidities, such as over weight, diabetes, hypertension or cardiac and chronic respiratory diseases Further, detection of viral RNA in the placenta or in foe tal membranes shows that while likely to be rare, it is possible that infection with SARSCoV2 can be passed from mother to baby. Based on a series of studies, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed pregnancy as one of the risk factors for severe disease in May 2021, and recently, the World Health Organization revised its recommendation for vaccination to include pregnant women in Category II to be prioritised for vacci nation, along with other comorbidities. Almost 100 countries now have policies that allow some levels of permission for the vaccination of pregnant wo men.  The Government of In dia made a recommendation for the vaccination of preg nant women in early July 2021, and many states have started or are set to start, but many questions remain. Matter of safety Akey area of concern for pregnant women is safety. Pregnant women are gener ally excluded from vaccine trials as a precaution, but this creates a complication because without testing it is not feasible for regulators to make a recommendation for the use of a vaccine in this group . So trials for pregnant women, if they are done at all, tend to be done well after the accumulation of data from Developmental and Re productive Toxicology (DART) studies on animals and from clinical e†cacy and e“ectiveness studies. So far, the P‘zer, Moderna and Janssen vaccines in animals have not found any toxic ef fects or malformations, and studies for the Astra Zeneca vaccines. A few women (12 for P‘zer and 6 for Moderna) enrolled in the e†cacy trials of the mRNA vaccines were found to be pregnant or be came pregnant after enrol ment, and no safety issues were identi‘ed, but the num bers are small. A recent ana lysis of the real world use of vaccines in pregnant women was published by the US CDC in the  New England Journal of Medicine,  reporting on al most 36,000 women given mRNA vaccines showed a small increase in pain at the injection site, but no other di“erence in sidee“ects. Ov er 1,10,000 pregnant women are enrolled in the CDC v safe registry and data on sa fety will continue to accumu late. Some data shows that mothers can pass their anti bodies to the baby through the placenta, but to verify whether the antibodies will protect the baby needs more data. Vectored vaccines The data available so far is largely from mRNA vaccines, but for vaccines that have or could be used in pregnant women, the recommenda tions are clearly in favour of use of inactivated vaccines or nonlive vaccines or their ciple that most malforma tions and most pregnancy losses occur in the ‘rst trim ester, so to avoid any future attribution of congenital anomalies or abortions to the vaccine, vaccination might be considered later in pregnancy. However, the re commendation that vaccina tion can be started at any time during pregnancy or in case the ‘rst dose has alrea dy been given, the second dose can be given when due without consideration of the trimester is logical to achieve early protection of pregnant women.  Urgent need Vaccination of pregnant wo men is urgent and essential to protect them and their ba bies, and is a responsibility of the healthcare system. The Government of India should be commended for the recommendation, even as we ensure that monitoring of safety is enhanced through both passive and ac tive surveillance in vulnera ble subgroups. In future stu dies, the regulators and policymakers may wish to consider whether we could enrol pregnant women at an earlier stage, so that recom mendation for them could be made along with the general population. (Dr. Gagandeep Kang is Professor, Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.) equivalent. An issue that has been raised with regard to mRNA and vectored vaccines is lack of data on whether the vaccine or vector persists in the body or is widely distri buted beyond the vaccina tion site. Such studies are usually done for drugs which are expected to enter the sys temic circulation and not al ways required for vaccines, except with new adjuvants or other new components are used. It appears unlikely gi ven the rapid breakdown of mRNA and what is known about vectored vaccines, but this has not stopped anti vaxxers from claiming that the lipid nanoparticles of mRNA vaccines bind to ovar ies, even in the complete ab sence of such ‘ndings from DART studies.  Since pregnancy increases the risk of venous throm boembolism four to ‘ve times for women, a frequent ly asked question is whether the adenovirus vectored vac cines like Covishield or the Janssen should be used, be cause they are associated with a small risk of thrombo sis with thrombocytopaenia syndrome (TTS) in young pe ople. It is important to un derstand that TTS occurs when the body has or makes antibodies to a platelet pro tein leading to clot forma tion, which is a di“erent pro cess for thromboembolism in pregnancy. So far, there is no evidence that vectored vaccines increase the risk of the thromboembolism in pregnancy, but this will con tinue to be monitored in countries that have widely used these vaccines in wo men of reproductive age. For India, based on all that we know, all vaccines currently available are safe and should be used in pregnant women to safeguard them and their babies. A pregnancy registry is an important part of the overall safety monitoring of vaccines for the ‘rst few years after they are used and must be encouraged, espe cially in India, where we have a large birth cohort, and thus an opportunity to contribute to the global liter ature on vaccine safety. Finally, the timing of vac cination during pregnancy is frequently discussed. This is because of the general prin COVID19 vaccination safe for pregnant women In India, based on all that we know, all vaccines currently available are safe and should be used in pregnant women Gagandeep Kang <>Pregnant womenare generallyexcluded from vaccine trials as a precaution, but without testing it is not feasible for regulators to make a recommendation for the use of a vaccine in this group. Researchers at IIT Madras have developed an AI tool called NBDriver (neighbour hood driver) for use in ana lysing cancercausing muta tions in cells. By looking at the neighbourhood, or con text, of a mutation in the ge nome, it can look at harmful ﬁdriverﬂ mutations and dis tinguish them from neutral ﬁpassengerﬂ mutations.  This technique of looking at the genomic neighbour hood to make out the nature of the mutation is a novel and largely unexplored one. In a paper published in the journal  Cancers,  the re searchers explain that the nature of the mutation de pends on the neighbour hood, and how this tool may be used to draw the line bet ween driver and passenger mutations.  B. Ravindran, head of the Robert Bosch Centre for Da ta Science and AI at IIT Ma dras and one of the corres ponding authors, said in a press release that one of the major challenges faced by cancer researchers involves the di“erentiation between the relatively small number of ﬁdriverﬂ mutations that enable the cancer cells to grow and the large number of ﬁpassengerﬂ mutations that do not have any e“ect on the progression of the disease. In previously published techniques, researchers typ ically analysed DNA se quences from large groups of cancer patients, compar ing sequences from cancer as well as normal cells and determined whether a par ticular mutation occurred more often in cancer cells than random, said Prof. Kar thik Raman, from the bio technology department of IIT Madras and another cor responding author. ﬁHowev er, this ‚frequentist™ ap proach often missed out on relatively rare driver muta tions,ﬂ he noted, adding that some studies have also looked at the changes caused by the driver muta tions in the production of es sential biological products such as proteins. Statistical modelling The method of distinguish ing between driver and pas senger mutations solely by looking at the neighbour hood is novel. ﬁThrough ro bust statistical modelling, we show that there is a signi‘ cant di“erence in the pat tern of sequences (or con text) surrounding the driver and passenger mutations,ﬂ said Shayantan Banerjee, who is a master™s student in the Department of Biotech nology, IIT Madras, and the lead author of the paper.  Accuracy of tool The researchers studied a dataset containing 5,265 mu tations to derive the model. According to Prof. Raman, NBDriver, had an overall ac curacy of 89% and ranked second out of 11 prediction algorithms. In comparison, he said that the top perform ing tool, or FATHMM, achieved an accuracy of 91% on the same dataset. For the future, the group aims to develop an easyto use draganddrop web inter face that will enable cancer researchers with limited computational or program ming skills to get predictions and extract genomic infor mation on their preferred set of mutations. ﬁWe will also be pursuing further studies on the context [or neigh bourhood] of these muta tions, and how they impact the evolution of cancer. Why do we see di“erences in the context between the driver and passenger mutations in the ‘rst place?ﬂ said Prof Raman.The group also plans that NBDriver will be a part of a broader cancer genomic se quence analysis "pipeline" being developed at the centres.

Ho wever, they should carry certi†cates stating they are fully vaccinated. Earlier rules mandated that a test had to be taken 48 hours prior to the travel and only those with a negative RT PCR test could enter Maha rashtra. In an email to The Hindu, Dr. Giridhara Ba bu,Epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, explains why doing away with RT PCR testing is not correct and how it could endanger others. Since fully vaccinated people can still get infected, is it a correct decision by the Maharashtra government to do away with the requirement of RTPCR testing for fully vaccinated people? We need to understand that testing is done to identify pe ople with infections so that they can be isolated. This ap plies to everyone irrespec tive of the vaccination sta tus. Increasingly, it is seen that the vaccinated persons can get infected. Not testing vaccinated persons is an ill considered and unjust deci sion, mostly to reduce the inconveniences to the vacci nated persons.  From the perspective of rights of the unvaccinated, it is important to protect them from getting the infection from everyone, including vaccinated persons. There is also evidence that there is high incidence of break through infections in vacci nated persons, even among those who have taken two doses of mRNA vaccines. The e†cacy of the vaccines is tested against hospitalisa tion and in preventing deaths. While reductions in infection is the ultimate goal of higher vaccination cover age, this is not the primary outcome in vaccine trials or possible in settings with low vaccination coverage. I would recommend testing everyone, especially the vac cinated persons. WHO says vaccine breakthrough infections will be mild or asymptotic. So how likely are fully vaccinated people to spread the virus when infected? There is strong evidence that vaccination o“ers the great est protection against death and hospitalisation. Howev er, there is little evidence that the ability to transmit COVID19 will greatly dimin ish. The transmission, even when is at a lower rate, can [happen] from the vaccinat ed to unvaccinated indivi duals. Vaccinated people could potentially still be come infected and spread the virus to others. Does mild/asymptotic infection in fully vaccinated people imply that the viral load is less and hence they are less likely to infect others? Although COVID19 vaccines might reduce viral load in persons with breakthrough infection, there is limited evidence [to ascertain] whether it will result in low er viral shedding, thereby further suppress the onward transmission. Evidence available for mRNA vaccine suggests that the infections occurring after 12 days of vaccination have signi‘cant ly reduced viral loads at the time of testing. We need to establish the relation of viral load and viral shedding for di“erent vaccines and against di“erent variants of concern. In the absence of such evidence, it is prema ture to conclude that vacci nated persons will have low er viral shedding and, therefore, [it is] less contagious. Since only 8% in India are fully vaccinated, is exemption from RTPCR testing for fully vaccinated people a correct decision? In India, it is early to consid er exempting from testing. I do see a great opportunity for novel rapid tests, espe cially if there are alternative noninvasive options. Ex emption from RTPCR test ing may be replaced once such tests are available, re liable and feasible to imple ment in India. Also, in symp tomatic persons, our earlier study has shown high sensi tivity while using the RAT test. In persons with no symptoms, RTPCR is the best available option as of now. At a time when vaccine shortage has been reported from several States and vaccination coverage is not uniform in urban and rural areas and even within urban areas, will treating fully vaccinated people di†erently aggravate inequities? Absolutely, given the global dynamics of vaccine injus tice, unfortunately, getting vaccinated is a rare privilege due to many reasons. These include noneligibility, non availability and lack of a“or dability. Treating vaccinated people di“erently will in duce and worsen the inequi ties in the community, in cluding those exacerbated by inequitable health system access. It is also unethical because if exempted, the vaccinated can get infected and infect those who have had no access or opportuni ty to get vaccinated yet. ‚Waiving testing for the fully  vaccinated is illconsidered™ Vaccinated people can potentially get infected once more and spread the virus to  others  R. Prasad Giridhara Babu SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT Roots of bias Earlier research of the last decade had shown that in lab settings, a rat would rather help a fellow rat who is in distress rather than an unfamiliar newcomer to the lab. Now, a study by scientists at University of California, Berkeley, finds the brain regions that drive the rats to focus on others dear to them, when in a crisis. The study, published in  eLife,  further suggests that humans, being so similar, may very well share this ingrained neuronal bias.  SNAPSHOTSMeteorologists were stunned this week when three succes sive thunderstorms swept across the icy Arctic from Si beria to north of Alaska, un leashing lightning bolts in an unusual phenomenon that scientists say will become less rare with global warming. ﬁForecasters hadn™t seen anything like that before,ﬂ said Ed Plumb, a National Weather Service meteorolo gist in Fairbanks, speaking about the storms that started on Saturday. Typically, the air over the Arctic Ocean, especially when the water is covered with ice, lacks the convective heat needed to generate lightning storms. But as cli mate change warms the Arc tic faster than the rest of the world, that's changing, scien tists say. Tripled in frequency Episodes of summer lightn ing within the Arctic Circle have tripled since 2010, a trend directly tied to climate change and increasing loss of sea ice in the far north, scien tists reported in a March stu dy published in the journal Geophysical Research Let ters.  As sea ice vanishes, more water is able to evapo rate, adding moisture to the warming atmosphere. ﬁIt™s going to go with the temperatures,ﬂ said coauth or Robert Holzworth, an at mospheric physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. These electrical storms threaten boreal forests fring ing the Arctic, as they spark ‘res in remote regions alrea dy baking under the round theclock summer sun.  The paper also document ed more frequent lightning over the Arctic™s treeless tun dra regions, as well as above the Arctic Ocean and pack ice. In August 2019, lightning even struck within 100 ki lometers of the North Pole, the researchers found. In Alaska alone, thunder storm activity is on track to increase threefold by the end of the century if current cli mate trends continue, ac cording to two studies by scientists at the National Cen ter for Atmospheric Re search in Boulder, Colorado, published over the last year in the journal  Climate Dynamics.ﬁWhat used to be very rare is now just rare,ﬂ said Rick Thoman, a climate scientist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As the parade of Arctic storms this week de monstrated, lightning is al ready appearing in unex pected places, he said. ﬁI have no memory of three consecutive days of this kind of thingﬂ in the Arctic.  On the water On the water, the lightning is an increasing hazard to ma riners, and vessel tra†c is in creasing as sea ice retreats, Holzworth said. People can become lightn ing rods and usually try to get low for safety. That™s tough to do on ’at tundra or ocean ex panse. ﬁWhat you really need is to pay better atten tion to the lightning fore casts,ﬂ he said. Rare Arctic lightning storms  strike north of Alaska  Unusual storms:  These will become less rare with global  warming. GETTY IMAGES ReutersWhy does Mercury have such a big iron core? Astudy by researchers from the University of Maryland disputes the prevailing hypothesis on why Mercury has a bigsized core relative to its mantle (the layer between its core and crust). Scientists had argued that hitandrun collisions with other bodies during the formation of our solar system resulted in much of Mercury™s rocky mantle being removed, leaving behind the big, dense, metal core inside. But new research reveals that Sun™s magnetism is the reason for this and not the collisions. The researchers developed a model showing that the density, mass and iron content of arocky planet™s core are in’uenced by its distance from the Sun™s magnetic ‘eld(Progress in Earth and Planetary Science). There is a gradient in which the metal content in the core drops o“ as the four inner planets of our solar system get further from the Sun. The current work explains this by showing that the distribution of raw materials in the early forming solar system was controlled by the Sun™s magnetic ‘eld. The new model shows that during the early formation of our solar system, when the young Sun was surrounded by a swirling cloud of dust and gas, grains of iron were drawn toward the centre by the Sun's magnetic ‘eld. When the planets began to form from clumps of that dust and gas, planets closer to the sun incorporated more iron into their cores than those further away.

THE HINDU VISAKHAPATNAM
SUNDAY,JULY18,2021 13FAQThe story so far: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday banned Mastercard from issuing new debit and credit cards to customers in India with e†ect from July 22. According to the RBI, the U.S. cardissuer has failed to comply with the local data storage rules announced by the central bank in 2018. The ban has unsettled banks operating in India that use Mastercard™s services to issue a variety of cards to their customers.  What is the RBI™s data localisation policy?  In 2018, the Indian central bank had issued a circular ordering card companies such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express to store all Indian customer data locally so that the regulator could have ﬁunfettered supervisory accessﬂ. This meant that foreign card companies had to store complete information about transactions made by Indian customers in servers located within India. Companies were initially required to comply with these rules within six months. The reason o†ered by the RBI to back up its data localisation rule was that local storage of consumer data is necessary to protect the privacy of Indian users and also to address national security concerns. Since the order, Mastercard, Visa and other foreign card companies have lobbied to dilute the rules. But the RBI has remained strict that companies must comply with its data localisation rules. Consequently, Mastercard deleted Indian customer data from its foreign servers and promised to invest in building local servers in India to store local customer data. The RBI, however, has not been impressed. It has banned Mastercard from issuing new cards to customers from July 22. Reuters reported Mastercard as having said it was ﬁdisappointedﬂ with the RBI™s decision and it had provided regular updates on its compliance with the rules since 2018. The company was quoted as saying it would continue to work with the Indian central bank to provide any additional details required to resolve its concerns.  Existing Mastercard customers, however, can continue to use their cards. Earlier this year, American Express and Diners Club International were also banned by the RBI from issuing new cards after they failed to comply with the 2018 circular.  What is the need for local data storage? Experts believe that customer privacy and national security are genuine concerns that need to be taken seriously. However, many also believe that data localisation rules are too stringent and they could simply be used by governments as tools of economic protectionism. For instance, they argue, it may not be strictly necessary for data to be stored locally to remain protected. Broadly speaking, formal international laws to govern the storage of digital information across borders may be su“cient to deal with these concerns. Governments, however, may still mandate data localisation in order to favour local companies to foreign ones.  China, for example, has used its cybersecurity laws to discriminate against foreign companies. A similar trend may be playing out in India with the Centre™s emphasis on economic selfsu“ciency. In 2018, Mastercard had launched a complaint with the U.S. government that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was actively promoting Indian cards like RuPay and that it was a†ecting the business of foreign card companies. Governments may also believe that mandating foreign companies to set up local infrastructure can boost their local economies.  What lies ahead? Indian banks that are currently enrolled in the Mastercard network are expected to make alternative arrangements with other card companies. The process is expected to take a few months, and their card business is expected to take a signi‘cant hit meanwhile. The RBI™s data localisation policy, as it burdens foreign card companies, may end up favouring domestic card issuers like RuPay. Mastercard owns about onethird of the market share in India, and the RBI™s ban is likely to signi‘cantly bene‘t its competitors. RBL Bank, for instance, has decided to enter into an agreement with Visa after the RBI™s ban on Mastercard. Similarly, the ban on American Express and Diners Club earlier this year bene‘ted the Indian card network RuPay. Some believe that even Visa, a foreign company which dominates card payments in India, may come under regulatory pressure in the near future. Thus, the card payments sector may end up being restricted to a few domestic companies, which in turn can lead to reduced competition. This could mean higher costs and lower quality services for customers.  It is also worth noting that in today™s digital economy data have turned out to be a valuable commodity, which companies as well as governments have tried to gain control over. Information about spending patterns and other customer data can be monetised by companies in a variety of ways. With no clear rules on who owns customer data and to what extent, con’icts over data ownership are likely to continue for some time.  Curbs on Mastercard  What are the rules on data storage and why has the RBI barred the  U.S. company from taking on  new customers in India?  Existing Mastercard customers will be allowed to use their cards. Earlier, the RBI banned American Express and Diners Club from issuing new cards after they failed to comply with the 2018 circular on data localisation Prashanth Perumal J.  In trouble:The ban has unsettled banks that use Mastercard™s services to issue a variety of cards. REUTERSThe story so far: On Wednesday, social media platform Twitter released its Transparency Report for the second half of last year (July 1 to December 31), in which it was revealed that India was the single largest source of government information requests. India also was one of the prominent sources of legal demands for removal of content, according to the report.  What™s the transparency report all about?  Twitter started publishing a biannual report Š Twitter Transparency Report Š in 2012. The original goal, it says in its blog, ﬁwas to provide the public with recurring insights into government pressures that impacted the public, whether through overt political censorship or by way of compelling account data through information requestsﬂ.  It further says, ﬁA lot has changed since 2012. It is now more important than ever that we also shine a light on our own practices, including enforcement of the Twitter Rules and our ongoing work to disrupt global statebacked information operations.ﬂ  Over the years, the scope of the report has been expanded gradually. Additional categories such as nongovernment legal requests, trademark notices, coordinated manipulation, and so on, have been added from time to time. This aspect of reporting isn™t rare any more.  Google, which has been issuing its transparency reports since 2010, says in its blog that ﬁtransparency reporting is an increasingly common practice across industriesﬂ. It then goes on to list over 40 brands, from Facebook to Reddit, and from Uber to Yahoo!, that undertake transparency reporting.  What are the highlights of the latest report?  As mentioned above, there are di†erent categories under which Twitter provides the data. One of the main categories is ‚Government Information Requests,™ and this includes ﬁboth emergency and routine legal demands for account information issued by law enforcement and other government agenciesﬂ. The report noted that there was a 15% increase in such requests (and more than a 100% increase in the number of accounts speci‘ed in these requests) compared with the JanuaryJune 2020 period.  Notably, for the ‘rst time in the history of the transparency report, the U.S. wasn™t the ﬁtop global requesterﬂ. India was. It accounted for 25% of the global volume and 15% of the global accounts speci‘ed. The U.S., however, submitted the highest volume of global emergency requests, at 34%, followed by Japan (17%) and South Korea (16%). Twitter describes routine requests as ﬁlegal demands issued by government of law enforcement authorities (e.g. subpoenas, court orders, search warrants)ﬂ that compel it to turn over account information. Emergency requests, on the other hand, may be entertained ﬁif we are provided with su“cient information to support a good faith belief that there is an imminent threat involving danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, and we have information relevant to averting or mitigating the threatﬂ.  Under the category of ‚Government Information Requests,™ Twitter says it ﬁnarrowed or did not disclose information in response to 70%ﬂ of the requests. One of the other signi‘cant subcategories is ‚Legal Demands™, which provides data about court orders and other formal demands to remove content. The source of such demands can be ﬁgovernmental entities and lawyers representing individualsﬂ. While the number of global legal demands fell 9% to 38,524, a whopping 94% of the demands came from just ‘ve countries (Japan, India, Russia, Turkey and South Korea).  Japan was the top requester in this category, accounting for 43% of the total. India was next, at 18%. Japan™s requests, Twitter says, were largely related to ﬁlaws regarding narcotics and psychotropics, obscenity, or money lendingﬂ.  Alarge portion of Russian requests related to its laws prohibiting the promotion of suicide. This section of the report also notes that ﬁ199 accounts of veri‘ed journalists and news outlets from around the world were subject to 361 legal demands, a 26% increase in the number of accounts since the previous reporting period. These included removal requests from India (128), Turkey (108), Pakistan (52), and Russia (28)ﬂ.  The compliance rate, which is the ﬁpercentage of information requests where Twitter produced at least some sort of requested account informationﬂ, in the case of requests emerging from India was far less compared with the average of the worldwide data.  What else is notable about the new report?  Twitter has started reporting about two additional things. One is an impressions metric, which ﬁcaptures the number of views violative Tweets received prior to removalﬂ. The other is about the adoption of twofactor authentication ﬁto keep accounts safe and secureﬂ. About the ‘rst, Twitter said violative tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all tweets globally during this period, and it had removed 3.8 million tweets that ’outed its rules. Only 6% of the removed tweets had more than 1,000 impressions.  Was there another report speci†c to India?  On July 11, it published ‚Twitter™s India Transparency Report,™ under the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. It will be a monthly report from now on. This comes after months of uneasiness between the government and Twitter over the latter™s noncompliance with the new rules, including the delay in the appointment of a grievance o“cer. The social media platform has just complied with that requirement. This report dealt with user grievances and proactive monitoring, which Twitter says refers to ﬁcontent proactively identi‘ed by employing internal proprietary tools and industry hash sharing initiativesﬂ. In the MayJune period, it reportedly suspended over 18,000 accounts for child sexual exploitation and a further over 4,000 accounts for promotion of terrorism. Is Twitter acceding to takedown requests?  How has the social media platform reacted to pleas for information data from governments around the world?  Sriram Srinivasan  True picture: India is one of the prominent sources of legaldemands for removal of content, says the report.  APOn July 11, it published ‚Twitter™s India Transparency Report,™ under the new Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021. It will be a monthly report unlike the biannual Transparency Report The story so far:  The second wave of COVID19, which began rising in Kerala in the second week of April, peaked midMay, when the State was reporting around 44,000 cases daily and had about 4.45 lakh active cases in the community. The test positivity rate (TPR) hovered around 30%. The State then went into a total lockdown for over a fortnight, after which the case graph came down. But since the past one month or more, the epidemic curve has remained on a plateau, logging around 10,000 cases12,000 cases every day, and the TPR is at 10%11%. At a time when COVID19 cases across the nation have come down sharply, Kerala accounts for about 30% of the country™s active caseload. In the past two weeks, the case graph has been rising again, recording a 20% growth. On July 17, Kerala reported 16,148 fresh COVID19 cases. Maharashtra, which has also seen cases rising, registered 8,172 fresh cases on the same day. Why is the epidemic curve not coming down? Public health experts point out that what is happening in Kerala now is no di†erent than what was witnessed in the State after the ‘rst wave. The ‘rst wave peaked in Kerala by the end of last October, the curve plateaued and remained unchanged for a long time. In JanuaryFebruary, recording between 1,500 and 3,000 fresh cases daily, Kerala accounted for over 45% of the active cases in the country. The epidemic curve never hit the baseline after the ‘rst wave in Kerala because of two things Š the largescale mixing of people and huge gatherings and rallies during the campaigning in February ahead of the election in April, which was followed by the arrival of the highly transmissible Delta variant. The ‘rst wave was yet to taper down, when Kerala rode into the second wave with a daily caseload of over 2,500 in the second week of April. The case graph then rose exponentially to reach a daily tally of almost 45,000 cases by midMay. Other States had already experienced the worst of the second wave when the curve began rising in Kerala. Because the second wave was delayed, the epidemic curve in the State is expected to remain on aplateau for a prolonged period and at a higher daily average of fresh cases (because of the Delta variant). What is the rate of community transmission? The third round of the national seroprevalence survey, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in three districts of Kerala in January, revealed that only 11.6% of the population had been exposed to the virus, against a national average of 21%. This meant that when the second wave struck, 89% of the State™s 3.5crore population was immunologically naive and at risk of contracting COVID19. When a highly transmissible virus variant like Delta is in circulation among a susceptible population, the level of e“ciency with which the community was maintaining nonpharmacological means of protection against the virus (masking and physical distancing) will no longer be enough to check transmission. Cases will continue to occur till a chunk of the population is a†ected or the transmission is reduced substantially through vaccination. Testing has been consistent in Kerala, with an average of 1.3 lakh samples tested daily. The o“cial stance is that Kerala is picking up one out of every three infections in the community, while the national rate is one in 25 infections.  What has been  Kerala™s strategy? Kerala™s strategy in COVID19 containment has always been to keep a tight check on transmission through targeted testing, contacttracing and isolation of infected individuals. The attempt was always to delay the peak of the curve and spread out the infection so that the cases never exceeded the health system capacity. At the peak of the second wave too, though the health infrastructure was severely stressed, the State managed to tide over the situation fairly well. There were tense situations but people were never denied care nor were there distressing scenes of people running around for oxygen beds or ventilators. Unlike the sharp rise and fall of the epidemic curve in most States, Kerala™s epidemic curve had a gradual rise and decline. This means that while the duration of the epidemic would be longer, the impact on the community would be less.  What is the current situation? Aprolonged plateauing of the epidemic curve and a slight increase in transmission after the lockdown was expected. However, a 20% growth in cases after the plateau over the last two weeks is beginning to look worrying. Cases are going up mainly in the northern districts. The active caseload, which came down below the 1lakh mark, has climbed to 1.24 lakh again, and while ICU occupancy is down, new hospital admissions are showing a rising trend. Did something go wrong postlockdown? The State™s current strategy of allowing relaxations, solely on the basis of TPR, has turned out to be unscienti‘c, counterproductive and has been criticised by the scienti‘c community as well as the people. The reliability of TPR as an epidemiological indicator of disease transmission is dependent on who is being tested. Testing among primary contacts of the known COVID19 cases and highrisk individuals will show more infections in the community but this will mean an increased TPR and another round of lockdown. Now that the government has linked TPR to lockdown relaxations, the reduction of TPR has become the goal for local bodies. Rather than targeted testing, the focus is now on reducing TPR by organising mass testing camps where asymptomatic people are o†ered incentives to test themselves. Increasing the denominator by testing a large population and testing within a relatively lowrisk population can arti‘cially bring about a reduction in TPR. The State has to break the transmission now by ‘nding active pockets of disease in the community through diligent targeted testing and tracing of primary contacts and highrisk individuals. ﬁWhat is needed is microcontainment, rather than closing down an entire panchayat based on TPR. Skewed policies such as restricting the opening of shops to certain days of the week is actually leading to overcrowding and superspread events,ﬂ a Health o“cial admitted. What happens next? Going forward, increasing the pace of vaccination and keeping a sharp eye on the circulation of SARSCoV2 variants through continuous genomic surveillance assumes importance.  Compared with the rest of India, Kerala has managed vaccination very well, administering the ‘rst dose to 45% of its population above 18 years and the second dose to 17% as on July 17. Though the State has the capacity to administer 2.5 lakh3 lakh doses a day, erratic vaccine supply has made this impossible. The State is ahead as far as genomic surveillance goes, with institutions doing targeted sequencing, apart from the whole genomic sequencing done at national institutes. Over 80% of the samples analysed in the State in recent months have been the Delta variant, though more cases of Delta Plus have also been surfacing. Kerala is also planning to do a seroprevalence survey soon, including among children. The seropositivity is expected to be much higher than what it was during the ICMR survey in January, given that over 31 lakh people have already had COVID19, and have natural immunity, apart from the proportion of the population who have vaccinederived immunity. Why is there a COVID spike in Kerala?  Has the State lifted the  lockdowns too quickly? What  should be the strategy to  contain transmission now? C.
